it turned off and never turned on again",

       "Does get too hot and turns off for excessive heat it not fair to pay so much money for that cámara",
       "I purchased the Insta360 X4 on March 26, 2025, and received it on March 31. I was excited to use this camera, especially after watching numerous positive reviews and reading about its durability and 
performance in demanding conditions. From day one, I noticed it gets unusually hot during recording, but I initially brushed it off, thinking it was just part of its high-performance nature. Everything worked 
fairly well until May 1, when I brought it to a major police sports event, a high-profile assignment where I was expected to capture key footage. I recorded in 8K 30fps during midday under a sunny sky. To my shock 
and embarrassment, the camera overheated and shut down just 3 minutes into recording.",
       "Este nuevo modelo tiene muchísimos problemas para hacer lo que promete por sobre calentamiento... Puedes perder momentos importantes porque se apaga automáticamente",
       "Camera is very laggy and gets very hot very quickly when recording really bummed with how expensive this product cost for it to perform so poorly",
       "I bought the Insta360 X5 expecting a great camera, but what I got was a camera that couldn't record for more than five minutes without serious overheating."

issues. It has a lot of features, the quality of the pictures are phenomenal. The camera can be tricky to navigate. While recording video, I couldn't find an option to zoom. Photos and videos have to be downloaded 
through the app, and the 360 feature can't be shared directly to social media for others to experience. Overall, it just didn't fit my needs and I did not want to spend the extra time to explore more."

South Korea, but once I arrived in Thailand and Indonesia, it repeatedly showed a "no SD card" error. I tried several different SD cards, including the original one that came with the camera, but nothing 
worked.",

every other card you have used for the entire time you have owned this ...thing ...will.",
