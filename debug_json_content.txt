       "I purchased the Insta360 X4 on March 26, 2025, and received it on March 31. I was excited to use this camera, especially after watching numerous positive reviews and reading about its durability and 
performance in demanding conditions. From day one, I noticed it gets unusually hot during recording, but I initially brushed it off, thinking it was just part of its high-performance nature. Everything worked 
fairly well until May 1, when I brought it to a major police sports event, a high-profile assignment where I was expected to capture key footage. I recorded in 8K 30fps during midday under a sunny sky. To my shock 
and embarrassment, the camera overheated and shut down just 3 minutes into recording.",
       "Does get too hot and turns off for excessive heat it not fair to pay so much money for that cámara It's great to be able to shoot 360 but can't not stay too long on without getting hot",
       "Camera is very laggy and gets very hot very quickly when recording really bummed with how expensive this product cost for it to perform so poorly",
       "Este nuevo modelo tiene muchísimos problemas para hacer lo que promete por sobre calentamiento... Puedes perder momentos importantes porque se apaga automáticamente",

though my computer meets the minimum system requirements, both the Insta360 Studio app and the mobile app are terribly optimized. The desktop software is basically useless—it crashes or throws errors when trying to
load a simple 3-minute video.",
