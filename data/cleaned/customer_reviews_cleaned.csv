From ""wont stay connected"" to ""very slow button response"". I dont think I have ever hated a product so much as this camera. The problems with this camera seem to multiply as I try to use it. And dont even get me started on the complete lack of customer support. Their phone number routes you thru a set of loops that dont allow either escape or to get answers. Sorry I dont have days to learn how to access ""what my firmware is"" or the ""version of my app"". I need a camera that works when I take it outta the box. This one does not. I will send it back.",1,,2025-04-19T16:22:10.000Z,2025-08-17T05:31:09.000Z,2025/4/19 00:00
1,1 - US,1,421,gl_camera,B0DYP7X2FL,B0B9H572LC,75349769411,Just don't buy this aweful thing.,"Let me preface this review by saying that I am an ""IT guy,"" so I have a more than passing familiarity with all kinds of cameras, devices that use memory cards, apps, desktop applications, etc., and I can honestly say that if you just walk out to your backyard and light $300+ dollars on fire, you will experience less irritation than you would if you bought this piece of garbage.  It rarely works, and when it does the remote doesn't, or audio didn't record, or one video will be fine and, even though you hit record within one minute of your last recording, then next one will be upside down and have a blue hue to it.  A personal favorite is when you change SD cards, the empty one is recognized, then you turn the camera off, then on, and it will say ""No SD card.""  Or your SD card won't load on your computer, even though every other card you have used for the entire time you have owned this ...thing ...will.  If you value your memories and would like to actually look back on them some time, for God's sake buy a GoPro.  The Max 2 is supposed to come out some time in 2025, so do yourself a favor and move right on past anything made buy Insta360.  This camera is a complete joke.",1,,2025-04-07T05:13:55.000Z,2025-08-02T19:53:45.000Z,2025/4/5 00:00

It's great to use in places you're not sure where to point a camera because everything is so beautiful. I like to use it walking paths, so I can have that 'drone shot' of me walking without getting out my drone and all the new drone laws prohibits a lot of good locations where a drone would shine . The quality of footage is very good and the goodies in the free editing are really nice and easy to use. Comes with free editing software that takes a bit of getting used to if you haven't used key frames before but your videos will really pop with this new kind of footage. I've included a short ND fast forward option video I took at the Parthenon in Tennessee a couple of months ago.  So much versatility with this camera.",5,,2025-04-12T14:13:39.000Z,2025-08-21T12:23:54.000Z,2025/4/12 00:00

1,1 - US,1,421,gl_camera,B0DYP7X2FL,B0B9H572LC,75928181211,The most frustrating electronic device I've ever owned.,"After three hours I haven't been able to take a single image with it. The frustration of linking the camera to my cell device, then to my PC then being made to download apps to everything and still can't use the camera. The terrible translation makes it worse. The lack of instructions adds another layer. It insists being connected to everything yet will not go beyond an activating screen only to not activate and the loop repeats. I can't add anything about the camera because I can't use it. Re entering the same information multiple times, multiple restarts of every device and still nothing is working. The same ""you must activate this device."" is all I see. And the app wants access to everything, EVERYTHING. Maybe an update about the camera capabilities IF I can get to the point of using it. Forced to add a star that it doesn't deserve. UPDATE=== After a conversation with tech support I want to add you do not need wifi, you'll only need to enable it on your cell device and then attempt to connect the camera to it. And be sure you update to the latest firmware. Now I'm off to take a few pictures to see how the camera works. Added a star until after reviewing a few images for quality.",2,,2025-05-07T15:56:24.000Z,2025-08-24T15:38:09.000Z,2025/5/3 00:00

They are waterproof, but I haven't been brave enough to test that fully. I have crashed pretty hard, and fast with this camera and it has not gotten a scratch on it. The footage is so clear, compared to my gopro. I love how its unique dual lens design allows for sweet footage effects by going into tiny planet mode for transitions etc. It fits nicely into a pocket, without the selfie stick. Dollars to donuts this camera is tough to beat for the price. I use mine almost daily to make youtube, and other social content. Highly recommend. Another awesome feature is that there are 4 audio mics recording in unison, which allows you to listen in 360 also. The stabilization is unbeatable on this camera, except by the newest insta360 camera.

I did not expect to find something this easy to use, both in the field (one button to turn on and start recording / one button off) and back home in post production. Years of using a standard video camera and trying to get the pan just right or finding my shot just a little off. Now I just activate the camera and take care of editing later. I use the selfie stick to put the camera where I could not reach before and have even used it on a tripod.

A 360 camera is like having a multicamera film crew in your pocket...or like having one of those cranes that carries a film camera, which can be pointed in any direction, but this camera points in ALL directions at once.<br /><br />If you had unlimited cash and reckless abandon, you could hit the record button on this camera, chuck it across a field, and have a perfectly stable shot focused on whatever you want, if your SD card survives the aftermath..lol. The image stabilization works the same way YouTube videos can be optionally stabilized after you upload footage to the site...the software zooms in on your subject, creating a cropped image, and eliminates all jiggling that way. However, since this camera films everything around it at once, there is unlimited area for the software to zoom, resulting it completely stable footage in any direction, on any subject captured by the 2 lenses.<br /><br />Since each lens actually captures WIDER than 180 degrees (the area captured by each lens overlaps), the software is able to remove the selfie stick at the bottom, if you choose to frame the your shot focusing on yourself. This allows you to create footage that looks as if it is being shot from a drone following you (if you're clever and hold the stick in the right way).<br /><br />To frame your footage on what you want your video to be focused, you can use either the PC/mac software, or the phone app. Since your phone has accelerometers, you can play your footage back on the app while orienting your phone as you would your head when you look around at things, and focus on whatever you want after the fact. On the computer software, you simply drag the view to what you want to see in the shot, right-click to add a keyframe, and repeat.

I was excited to use this camera, especially after watching numerous positive reviews and reading about its durability and performance in demanding conditions. From day one, I noticed it gets unusually hot during recording, but I initially brushed it off, thinking it was just part of its high-performance nature.<br /><br />Everything worked fairly well until May 1, when I brought it to a major police sports event, a high-profile assignment where I was expected to capture key footage. I recorded in 8K 30fps during midday under a sunny sky. To my shock and embarrassment, the camera overheated and shut down just 3 minutes into recording. I tried multiple times, but the device kept shutting down due to heat.<br /><br />This camera is advertised as a rugged action cam, yet it couldn‚Äôt withstand standard outdoor conditions? That‚Äôs unacceptable. I had been hyping this device to colleagues and supervisors, many of whom were eager to see the results. Instead, I was left with incomplete footage and a lot of explaining to do. Not only did this damage my professional credibility, but it also made me lose confidence in the Insta360 brand.<br /><br />To make matters worse, I checked Amazon and realized the return window closed on April 30 ‚Äî just one day before the failure happened. That‚Äôs incredibly frustrating and feels like poor timing designed to work against honest customers.<br />For a camera in this price range and class, this kind of failure is just not acceptable.

Less than a year in, the selfie stick failed‚Äîsnapping at the thickest part (second segment)‚Äîcausing me to lose the entire camera while riding at low highway speeds on my cruiser.<br /><br />I contacted Insta360 customer service hoping for a resolution. Unfortunately, they refused to replace the camera, citing speed limitations of 80 km/h (49 mph) for the selfie stick‚Äîa detail never clearly stated in the product description or marketing materials. For a bundle marketed specifically for motorcycles, this kind of limitation is misleading and unacceptable.<br /><br />The X4 is a very expensive camera, and for the company to provide such a fragile mounting solution without proper warning is, in my opinion, dishonest.<br /><br />For comparison, I‚Äôve used a GoPro Hero8 for years, and when a mount failed, GoPro replaced it without question. That kind of support builds trust and brand loyalty.<br /><br />If you‚Äôre looking for a reliable setup for rear or front motorcycle footage, I strongly recommend researching other brands‚Äîespecially if you ride at normal highway speeds. I‚Äôll personally be switching back to GoPro.<br /><br />I‚Äôm sharing this in hopes that others don‚Äôt suffer the same loss.

Blenders, toasters, vacuums? When I spend close to $500 on an item I want to turn it on and it just just work. China is compiling huge databases of people that ""activate"" devices.<br />2) Misleading advertisement, it states (in the manual and elsewhere) that you can do loop recording and there are some videos that state you could use it as a dashcam. Not so, ""loop recording"" implies that a camera will record for an x amount of time finish recording that footage and start a new recording where the first one left of. Give me a break a $50 GoPro clone can do that!<br />The manual states: ""Loop Recording: Record continuously and save only the last fixed segment.""<br />No, it does not ""record continuously"" if you set it to record for 5 minutes when the 5 minutes are up so is your recording and you have to press record again, it does NOT continue to record for another 5 minutes in a new file. So if you plan on using it as a dashcam or to record a driving video you better know how long you'll be driving in advance, or set it to infinite recording until it fills the SD card.<br />Additionally recording at higher resolutions such as 8k will make it overheat like jet engine, so much so that they provide some kind of plastic shield to protect your hand.<br />The software you can download from insta's website does absolutely noting that your computer can't do on it's own already, why would you need software to download your files when you can already do that by plugging in the camera to your PC and use File Explorer.<br />In short, it's made for the ""me"" generation and for people who want to show how cool they are rather than have practical applications.",1,,2025-04-19T09:34:21.000Z,2025-08-13T08:47:24.000Z,2025/4/19 00:00

Unfortunately I bought this contingent on the fact that Insta360 promised they would deliver AEB functionality with a firmware update. I actually didn't realize it did not have that when I purchased it, seems like it should be a standard feature in any camera like this these days. They have now included an absolutely pathetic and abysmal AEB feature which is basically a ""virtual AEB"" that produces a low quality, low resolution image. I don't understand why they cannot implement actual AEB functionality, if it's a hardware limitation, they should have said that up front, rather than deceiving customers like myself into waiting for a disappointing firmware update that came after the camera was outside of the return window.<br /><br />On top of this, the interfacing between this camera and professional apps like Matterport is horrific. I bought this camera to replace my Ricoh Theta Z1, because I felt like it has very poor connectivity, but the X4 makes it look like Usain Bolt racing against an injured turtle. Not only does it take 2-3x as long with the X4 to take each scan and download it, but it fails around 30% of the time after you've waited 30-45 seconds for it to finish, and then disconnects every 7-8 scans, requiring you to jump through hoops to reconnect to it.<br /><br />Overall I bought this camera primarily for professional purposes, and it is categorically not for professionals in any way shape for form.

If you‚Äôre used to shooting with a decent regular camera or even a recent flagship smartphone, the drop in image quality is going to be noticeable. And when you get into 360 cameras, you have to temper those expectations even more.<br /><br />By nature, a 360 cam is spreading its pixels over a much larger field of view, and then the stitching process seems to introduce extra noise and grain that you don‚Äôt really see with regular action cams like the DJI Osmo series. At first I honestly thought mine might have been faulty, but after comparing it with videos on YouTube from others using the same camera in similar mountain biking scenarios, I realized this is just the current state of 360 cams in general.<br /><br />Looking at footage from the newer X5 model with the larger sensor, it does look like Insta360 is improving things, but it‚Äôs still not on par with the crispness you‚Äôd expect if you‚Äôre comparing it to a modern phone camera. For a quick reality check: if you‚Äôve got a flagship phone from the last five years (Samsung S20, iPhone 14, etc.), it will easily produce cleaner, sharper video than any 360 camera currently available.<br /><br />What you are really paying for here is the durability, compact design, and of course the 360-degree field of view. On those counts, it delivers. The ability to reframe shots after the fact and capture the entire ride without worrying about where the camera is pointing is genuinely fun and useful.<br /><br />The Insta360 Studio software has also been better than I expected. If you want to do some basic color correction and editing like contrast, exposure, and other tweaks without relying on additional software, it handles those tasks easily, and you can export to multiple formats‚Äîincluding lossless ProRes.

Both workflows worked well and gave me solid results.<br /><br />All of that being said, I returned the camera. It just can't produce the quality of image that I am comfortable with. This isn't a direct knock to this device, but 360 cams in general. I will continue to wait until these cameras come out with bigger, better sensors and in the meantime may just switch to a regular action cam like the DJI osmos action cam which is cheaper and has slightly better quality (though lacks 360 function).",4,,2025-08-17T21:55:32.000Z,2025-08-22T11:47:06.000Z,2025/8/16 00:00

The camera itself is well built and high quality, and has both a front & back lens. It's actually a bit heavy. There are many options such as video, photo, timelapse, HDR, Timeshift, Bullet time, loop recording, dash cam, burst & interval shooting. There are so many options it takes a while to practice and understand how each option works. The bundle came with an additional battery, charger, extra lens covers, a screen protector, case and a tote bag. There is no SD card included and you have to purchase the selfie stick separately. The camera can be used on any mount with a 1/4 screw so you can get some great perspectives. It does run hot when filming in 8k and there is a thermal protector included in the main camera box. The videos it captures are really cool as you can see 360 degrees around you. However, the video editing can be a bit challenging and I consider myself a relatively experienced video editor. You can upload footage to your computer and use the editing software, or connect to the app and edit there. You can also import footage into Premiere Pro. Due to being 360 degrees, you can see wobbly areas in the footage where it is stitched together. It takes practice to get the end result you want if you want to slice & dice the footage you capture. Overall, it is a really nice, well made camera with lots of cool options. The fact you can use a selfie stick and not see the stick makes it appear like drone footage, which is really neat. It's great for action shots while riding a bike, snowboarding, and you can get a waterproof case for diving as well.

The bundle is a separate issue that I'll get to later. First, I'll say that the x4 is rightly considered one of the best 360 consumer cameras out there. The build quality is excellent, and the design is simply superb. Equally great is the software, which makes Insta360 the right choice by itself. I'm amazed by what you can do on your cell phone (somewhat more, actually, than what you can on your desktop). Everything works flawlessly. While my praise is glowing, my criticism is a bit harsh, too. As a professional filmmaker, I can't get around the fact that the video quality when the image is flattened to a traditional framing is basically that of a cell phone. And not a great quality cell phone either. In many videos that you'll make (and see online) it's not that noticeable because of all the other elements doing wild things in the frame. But set it up for a static shot and the level of compression is clear. There's more to image quality than resolution, and the processing, 8 bit, and what I expect is 4:2:0 sampling undermine the image. Textures move in and out of blotchiness; skin becomes rather plastic and hair brittle. The camera is making a lot of big compression choices that aren't uniform. This doesn't mean you shouldn't get the x4; you just need to have your expectations in line. For many content creators and social media lovers the x4 will spend more time exceeding your expectations than disappointing them; for professionals there are a lot of limitations, and the need to work in small bits. I will say that the color balance and dynamic range are very good.<br /><br />As for the bundle, you should carefully consider which of these items you need and how much they cost on their own.

Best thing to do is turn off mobile data permission for the app immediately, before pairing it with the camera.<br /><br />The cons for this kit :<br />1. X4 is no longer the newest, and I got this like a month before the X5 released. I think they're trying to get rid of the old stock.<br />2. No selfie stick included.<br />3. No SD card included<br />4. There's a lot of wasted space in the travel bag.<br />5. Two bumper cases included, one goes in the front and one on the back but they cannot be installed at the same time. What?<br />6. There's a bunch of unnecessary items for getting started, it's just a weird mix missing essentials but including non-essentials.<br />7. The camera does not have GPS, so you can't do Google Street View without using a GPS watch.<br />8. The camera cannot connect directly to a WiFi hot spot, only act as a host, so everything has to go through another device.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. On camera stitching and image stabilizer is really nice.<br />2. The workflow is pretty simple to get photos from camera to phone to shared sites.<br />3. 360 is neat.<br /><br />In my opinion, it is not a good time to buy X4. If you want to stay with Insta360, the X5 is the new one. If you want to have a very streamlined Google Street View workflow, the Panox V2 or newer have built in GPS, direct WiFi connect, and make that pretty smooth.<br /><br />There are still not very many options for sharing the full 360 videos with family members, so the value proposition in this device is more in that it can capture the full scene and then you edit the view as you export to a flat rectangle.

The basic kit includes the Insta360 X4 and, USB-C to USB-C charging cable. One battery, a small case that doesn‚Äôt hold much more than the camera and cable, Standard lens protectors, and the thermal guard. Action Bundle addition includes another battery and fast charger that holds up to 3 batteries, a screen protector, Premium Lens Guards, and a harder case that not only holds the camera, but also holds the fast charger, two batteries, and the standard size invisible selfie stick. Do note that there‚Äôs no selfie stick or micro SD card in this kit, so you‚Äôll need to purchase those separately. You might also consider buying a rubber lens protector to insulate them when you put the camera down or pack it away.<br /><br />Given the damage potential of the two fish eye lenses, it‚Äôs great to have the premium lens guards, which are aluminum and glass, whereas the standard lens guards are plastic. With this model, normally, a damaged lens would mean sending it off for repair and replacement. The standard and premium lens guards each have their own settings since you‚Äôre adding another layer at a distance from the lens, so make sure you change the appropriate setting. Keep in mind that adding a lens means you have to make sure both layers are clean, and each can cause some odd light refraction in certain circumstances. The ideal would be to avoid the lens guards, but depending on your use, I‚Äôd prioritize avoiding lens damage. For example, indoor static use on a secure monopod might be OK to use the bare lenses, but in an environment where the camera may topple, using the premium lens guards is wise.‚Ä®<br /><br />The thermal guard is purely for hand protection rather than heat dissipation.

The thermal guard makes it easier to handle.‚Ä®<br /><br />8K video also uses the battery a bit faster, so it‚Äôs a major plus that this kit includes a second battery and a fast charger.  The importance of shooting 9K is that, unlike earlier versions of this camera, you have a lot more resolution to zoom in if you‚Äôre using the video in a 4K timeline. The file sizes are large, and I‚Äôd always recommend using the high bit rate setting for quality. 5.7 K+ will yield a smaller file size, but I‚Äôd prefer to have the greater zoom potential. 5.7K (not plus) allows for higher frame rates if slow motion is important. At a normal 30fps, it handles lower light a bit better. All this gives you significant situational flexibility depending on your shooting situation.<br /><br />Photo mode shoots at either 72MP or 18MP when shooting 360, and half each if you‚Äôre just using single camera mode. For best dynamic range and internal processing, using PureShot is nice, although there‚Äôs also a photo HDR mode. Given the common uses, such as 360 real estate virtual tours, there‚Äôs a timer mode that allows you to get out of the picture before the photo is taken. ‚Ä®In both video and photo mode, there‚Äôs an array of auto and manual settings that give you many of the typical controls you‚Äôd expect.‚Ä®<br /><br />Additionally, there‚Äôs a bunch of interesting modes such as timelapse, timeshift, bullet time (be sure to get the bullettime accessories to make best use of that), loop recording, starlapse (night time time lapse), and burst mode.<br /><br />The kit comes with a plethora of manuals accounting for the camera and the use of each of the accessories, and they point to the website for much deeper tutorials complete with video guides as well. The documentation is one of the most thorough I‚Äôve seen, helpful for a novice. The smartphone app is equally intuitive, and between the camera and the app, they guide you through a trouble-free setup, including ins",5,,2025-05-12T01:30:41.000Z,2025-08-24T01:47:47.000Z,2025/5/10 00:00

This thing is awesome, I love it!","[[VIDEOID:f8fb13eaa7a1177839418aedf98228e1]] I ordered the Insta360 X4 in April 2025. I make little adventure/vacation vlogs for the trips my girlfriend and I take. I have tried to vlog with a full on ""professional"" setup with a mirrorless camera, a wide angle lens and a directional microphone and it was just way to cumbersome. The setup was big, bulky and expensive. I felt like I had to baby the equipment desperately trying to not damage anything. And I constantly was paranoid that someone was going to either try to steal my camera or attack me so that they could steal it LOL I would find myself fiddling around with the camera and the settings too much and worrying about getting the right shot and trying to make sure everything was framed correctly...using that setup was really REMOVING me from the moment. I wasn't having fun and enjoying the moment, I was too preoccupied with camera stuff and looking at everything through a screen. I abandoned that setup and picked up the Insta360 X4 and couldn't be happier! I love that the X4 is a tiny, little, lightweight camera! Shooting in 8k30fps 360 mode gives me some peace of mind knowing that as long as I'm recording/vlogging I'm always going to get the shot because I'll be able to reframe it later. I no longer have to keep my eyes planted on my camera screen or stress about wondering if I captured that moment correctly and if I need to try to re-shoot it. Everything is being captured. And I love that we now have 8K footage being captured so when I go to reframe it, the image quality is still going to be good. There is the option to shoot single lens mode at up to 4K60fps which is great, but I tend to just shoot full 360 mode. The battery life is great! It actually lasts quite a bit longer than my large mirrorless camera. The microphone/audio quality on the  X4 is great now!

I've had a GoPro for several years, using it to film everything from stuff around the house to outdoor and underwater action scenes, and have been very impressed with the quality and the design features.  This insta360 X4 is of similar or better quality than the GoPro I've had for years, and gives me not only the ability to make fantastic, creative, outdoor and scenery videos, but is also amazing to use for ""regular"" videos owing to the amazing versatility of being able to choose from a 360 degree panorama of 8K video.  (Imagine a video of your child opening a birthday present and being able to have, for say, a close-up of the present, but also your child's facial reaction, and any other element you might choose to grab from around the room, such as yourself, or others in attendance, or maybe just the room itself - everything is seen by the camera, and you get to choose what you want to see when you edit the video.)<br />  THE ACTION BUNDLE:<br />  THE EXTRA BATTERY & 3-PORT FAST CHARGE HUB: If you're doing lots of filming, having the extra battery and a hub for charging is really helpful, avoiding down-time waiting for a battery to charge.  The hub also recharges the batteries faster than recharging them in the camera using the USB port.<br />  THE PREMIUM LENS GUARDS: I didn't test them side by side with the standard lens guards that come with the camera itself.  They're recommended because they are harder to scratch than the standard covers, which is helpful because I do lots of work in sandy areas.  I am happy to have them because lens guards can save one a lot of money, protecting against scratching the camera lens which apparently costs in excess of $300 to replace.<br />  SCREEN PROTECTOR: Since the screen is made from Gorilla glass, I would not have opted for this extra protection (which is much like the screen protector one would stick onto a cell phone screen) except I often film in harsh, sand",5,,2025-05-21T13:10:51.000Z,2025-07-31T14:14:29.000Z,2025/5/17 00:00

The magic continues in editing whereby the user gets to choose from this 8K video what they want to look at, and how far they would like to zoom in, anywhere from a super-wide ""fisheye"" view, all the way to a reasonably tight close-up with little to no distortion.

I also ordered PNY brand SD cards https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WBT52KN?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1 and they worked well in the camera, providing the sort of data throughput that the 8K video requires.<br />  OVERALL CONCLUSION:  The insta360 X4 is an awesome camera, capable of doing things I'd only imagined before using it.  I found lots of helpful, instructional videos on line that led me through setting it up and using it (as well as well-written tutorials accessible right out of the editing software), plus lots of other helpful videos showing me how to get creative with it.

In all my experience, I can honestly say that this Insta 360 X4 is by far the most advanced and amazing action camera I‚Äôve ever owned. It‚Äôs expensive (which is one of the main reasons I had waited so long to get one) but having used it now I can honestly say that I regret not purchasing it years ago because it would have made my life SO much easier and captured so many additional memories.<br /><br />If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with 360 cameras, it‚Äôs basically an action camera that records everything around it, in every direction, at the same time, instead of just a single straight ahead view out of the front of the camera.

Even with a selfie stick I would constantly have to re-shoot my footage with my normal cameras to make sure I got myself in the shot, but that‚Äôs a thing of the past with this X4. Once the action is over and you go back to edit the video you can literally pan the video anywhere you want during playback, so you never have to worry if you ‚Äúgot the shot‚Äù. Trust me, you did. :)<br /><br />Having thoroughly tested this X4, here‚Äôs what I like and don‚Äôt like about it:<br /><br />LIKES:<br /><br />*Record without thinking- this is literally a camera you can walk around with and not have to worry about keeping anyone in the frame or making sure you got the shot. As long as the action is happening around the camera or within view of it, you can see it after the fact.<br /><br />*Video Clarity- This thing records up to 8K resolution videos. I don‚Äôt need anything in that high resolution lately so I do most of my recording in 4K to keep the files smaller and the footage is still incredible. But it‚Äôs nice to have the 8K option if I needed t",5,,2025-07-17T17:43:22.000Z,2025-08-24T02:01:17.000Z,2025/7/12 00:00

For each lens the light passes through a 90 degree prism and onto its own imaging sensor located horizontally in line with the lens but flipped 90 degrees about the vertical axis so it is parallel to the side of the camera body, roughly where the microphone slots are located.  The opposing lens system is symmetric to this and routes the light onto a sensor on the opposite side of the camera body.  This allows a longer light path from each lens to the respective imaging chip while also avoiding having the two heat-producing imaging chips placed back-to-back internally in the shallow depth between the lenses.<br /><br />However in the Insta360 camera each wide-field lens projects a circular image onto its respective imaging sensor, and this circle contains the entire image of one hemisphere (slightly more to allow overlap for stitching and hiding your selfie stick). This is sometimes called a crystal ball image because it looks like the world viewed through a glass sphere. Outside of this image circle the sensor receives no useful light and consequently right off the bat there is about a 21.5% loss of imageable information because the pixels outside this illuminated circle remain unused (a circle has 78.5% of the area of a square enclosing it, and 100% - 78.5% = 21.5%).  So the 8K camera (which by true pixel count is actually 7.68K) is further limited by the fact that the two square sensors are never illuminated outside of the image circles.  Out of 7680 x 3840 total pixels (about 29.5 million), only 23.2 million get used.<br /><br />Another thing to consider is that the circular images projected onto the square sensors are increasingly severely compressed optically near the edges",4,,2025-07-24T07:13:39.000Z,2025-08-13T09:27:53.000Z,2025/7/19 00:00

Think again of what the world looks like through a glass sphere; you can make out details in the center of the field but the edge distortion greatly compresses details. Therefore if you intend to crop the field of view of the camera in the editor you should always try your best to anticipate your flow and point one of the lenses directly at the area or action of central interest during recording.<br /><br />So regarding the subject of resolution, a camera of this type will provide the highest resolution (which will never reach 8K) only when you view the entire spherical world during playback.  This is what you sometimes see in videos when the view is absurdly wide-field, intended more for abstract effect, or in VR. If however you choose to use the camera to record everything around you at the moment and later crop as if you were using a narrower, more traditional camera field of view, you may end up with a rather low-resolution result.  If you study a chart showing the field of view for typical camera lenses of different focal lengths used with full-frame or APS-C cameras, and then realize that if you want to crop that limited degree of framing from 360 degree footage, you may end up with quite low resolution.<br /><br />In short, a video zoomed, panned, tilted, or rotated in post processing for the best ROI from an Insta360 when used in 360 degree mode is not going to produce images anywhere near the quality of a standard single-lens camera if the camera movements can be choreographed during the recording process.  But the beauty and value of recording the whole world at once comes when you don't know where the best view will occur until after the fact.<br /><br />Despite these concerns about limited resolution everyone knows how great the wide-field, sunny-day videos from an Insta360 camera look.

And in fact shortly after purchasing the X4 I realized that the X5 version had already been released. Since this review is already dated I will limit it to more general topics and only those specific issues that I have been able to pick up in a couple months of sporadic operation as a new user.<br /><br />The first section on Resolution may be skipped although it may give some insight into the limitations of what you can get out of an 8K 360 degree camera.  I would give this camera 5 stars for its wide-field video quality, but it doesn't have sufficient resolution to stand up to a great deal of zooming and cropping in post processing editing, hence the overall 4 star rating.<br /><br />Resolution considerations<br /><br />8k resolution in a camera sounds impressive at a time when the most readily available TV and prosumer video camera resolution is usually 4k. But reality sets in when you take a more in-depth look, particularly how it applies to a camera tasked with recording the entire spherical world around it rather than just a segment of that, which would be the case with an ordinary camera with a more limited field of view.<br /><br />The common resolution numbers that you hear proclaimed in display or camera specifications (2K, 4K, or 8K) refers to the approximate horizontal pixel count (2000, 4000, or 8000) of the display or the imaging sensor.  These are really just rounded-up approximations (because why would any manufacturer ever round down?) of the actual pixel count.  Depending on the aspect ratio of the display or imaging sensor there will be a vertical pixel count associated with that horizontal resolution. Numbers like 720p, 1080i or 1080p refer to the vertical resolution.  2K resolution has 1920 horizontal pixels, and and 4K has 3840 horizontal pixels, but the vertical pixel count can vary with the aspect ratio (wi",4,,2025-07-24T07:13:39.000Z,2025-08-13T09:27:53.000Z,2025/7/19 00:00

As mentioned earlier, if recording in 360 mode and if you know you are going to be cropping the field of view in post processing it is a good idea to point one of your lenses in that general direction as you record.  This will help to maintain the highest resolution at the center of the imaging sensor where it has the least amount of optical distortion, and at the same time this will put the splice at the periphery of the region of interest.<br /><br />There are couple settings that I find personally important, although these may not affect you.  Both of these are found under the menu Settings.  The first is  ""Touch to activate when off""  can be turned on to bring the display back up after it times out by simply touching the screen.  To preserve the battery I keep the screen on-time very short and I find tapping the screen to be easier that pressing the rather stiff side button.  And if you use a Bluetooth remote shutter (I have a wrist remote) be aware that you might want to keep the ""Bluetooth wakeup"" setting turned off to disable the ability of the remote to actually power on the camera.  A couple times when I turned on the Bluetooth remote some time before unpacking the camera I unzipped the case to find a very hot camera that had been powered on along with the remote.<br /><br />In hindsight I would consider the following:<br /><br />1) Before buying make sure that a later version of the camera hasn't already been released for sale ;(.<br />2) Stick with the standard lens protectors unless abrasion resistance is more important than image quality<br />3) Consider purchasing an aftermarket case more suited to the accessories you need to carry and not necessarily what comes with a kit<br />4) More batteries are always a good purchase, but consider options of getting them with the OEM kit or aftermark",4,,2025-07-24T07:13:39.000Z,2025-08-13T09:27:53.000Z,2025/7/19 00:00

While the X4 non-replaceable lenses really are replaceable when you get down to it, it is more of a tech-level repair that involves getting inside the camera's guts, something akin to replacing a phone battery on a ""not user serviceable"" device.  You will be slicing glue joints and it's not for everyone, where it appears the the X5 lens replacement is quite simple.<br /><br />Compared to my older Hero 8 GoPro I find the user interface on the X4 to be much easier to use.  Frankly I dislike almost everything about the GoPro, from the tiny screen with oversize icons to the huge quantity of dead sensor pixels that makes night sky timelapses look like absolute crap (unless you like stars to twinkle when they encounter dead pixels). There are still too many cryptic icon symbols to learn in the Insta360 menus, but there isn't much space for anything else.<br /><br />The X4 screen seems huge by comparison to the GoPro, and even though the interface design is somewhat similar with the pull-out markers on all sides it just seems more friendly to use with a much smaller percentage of the screen hogged up by icons.<br /><br />All of the buttons on the X4 are very firm and you are unlikely to accidentally press anything (except of course the touchscreen) in normal handling.  I think that, like with the GoPro, operating the menus with gloves would be difficult.<br /><br />One thing I still have trouble accepting is the fact that I can't seem to toggle Direction Lock at the camera itself.  It seemed strange at first in 360 mode to aim one of the lenses at the area of interest only to find that on playback (within the camera) the view would be fixed unless changed by scrolling on the camera's touchscreen.  Direction Lock can be turned on in the editor to track the camera's original orientation during recording.

It also seems that image distortion near the edges of the field of view is also slightly worse with the tempered glass protectors.  After my first impressions I looked into this subject and found a video comparison made with and without the two types of lens protectors using a ring LED light, and the internal reflections were actually worse with the premium protectors (the review channel was Roo's Reviews).  If I feel that I need the abrasion resistance of glass I will probably use them but if I'm anywhere near high-contrast lighting I think they will stay off.<br /><br />My kit came with a zippered case with a form-fitted insert but no slip-on camera cover.  I don't like to have to disassemble things for storage to nestle them into pockets, so I gutted the form-fitting insert to make more space.  I then bought a silicone cover that protects both lenses, but ditched that in preference to a zippered split cover that encloses the entire camera, even if left on a selfie-stick.  I can recommend the zippered, whole camera case for the lazy user like me.<br /><br />Voice control is limited to I think five commands, and it works reliably with the camera in hand or a couple feet away.  But out on the end of a stick or in noisy conditions I found that even when shouting the operation was not consistent.  I have and recommend a Bluetooth remote for more reliable control at a distance.<br /><br />One thing that I wish the X4 had compared to the X5 is the user-replaceable lenses (actual lenses, not talking about the lens protectors here). The lenses out of necessity project from the camera body on both faces and there is nothing that can be done in the way of guards (short of using the compromising domed lens protectors) without showing up in the final image.

Assuming you seek out a few of the excellent technical reviews before buying, this review will be limited to what a single user does and doesn't like and the perceived value of the purchase.<br /><br />Overall the X4 camera has a very solid feel and substantial density.  In particular you can tell when you insert the battery until it seals and clicks into place that this is a well-designed product.  When the battery retention tabs are pulled together a spring positively pops the battery out of its compartment.<br /><br />The camera can get very warm in use and in fact my kit came with a thermo-grip snap-on shell that is intended to make the camera more comfortable to hold. I don't necessarily think it needs this; the camera doesn't get that warm in the first place, and secondly a shell that insulates your hand from the camera body is also bound to limit the case heat dissipation to some degree.  If I want some protection I'll get a metal cage that protects the body on all edges without blocking airflow. I don't think the plastic shell is the best thing for camera health.<br /><br />My kit also came with a set of premium tempered glass lens protectors, which I wanted and thought I needed, in addition to the standard plastic protectors. My first impression of the premium lens protectors was not great, and this is largely due to the fact that their slightly larger size puts the inevitable surface dust more into focus and it becomes more noticeable, particularly when facing the sun.

I am however still a little perplexed at the rather high price of this particular kit.  Usually package deals are a better value than if you buy individual items, but at over $600 I can't see where this is the case when I have seen the camera with two batteries available for under $400.  This did not include a charger or premium lenses, but in hindsight I probably would not get either of those items or perhaps opt for less expensive third-party accessories.<br /><br />The Insta360 X-series really has revolutionized action videography in a way that would have been hard to imagine a few years ago.

In some ways this is a minor upgrade; the maximum resolution hasn't changed for example. But there are some game changers that make it a worthwhile purchase.<br /><br />I have focused on two:<br /><br />(1) The ability to replace lenses yourself is very welcome and a significant enough development in itself to warrant an upgrade. I have always babied my 360 cameras from GoPro Max, to X3 and X4 being constantly terrified of ruining the lens and therefore the camera. When cycling with the camera low to the ground I have used lens guards which always, always add distortion and increase flare significantly, compromising the usability of the footage you make. Now with X5 I I do not believe I will need to use lens guards at all, I have a replacement lens kit on order and will always keep one in my bag with the X5 when using it.<br /><br />(2) The other game changer is the audio quality. I did not care for audio on 360 cameras until X4 came along as the first 360 camera with good enough image quality to be used as a regular action camera, or even as a vlogging camera. With X4 I started using it for those purposes but the audio was, well it was 'OK'. What Insta360 have done with the audio on X5 is amazing, the microphone capsule hidden under the mesh on the camera deliver an incredible balanced and clear sound quality. Just set it to Auto wind noise reduction (your choice for weak or strong) and leave it there.<br /><br />Others have said they are having issues with the app upgrade and being able to register the X5. I am US based and a regular user of Insta360 cameras, my iPhone iOS app updated no problem and the X5 is now registered.<br /><br />IMO this is a very worthwhile upgrade eve if you just consider the replaceable lenses and audio quality.",5,,2025-04-26T02:20:24.000Z,2025-08-24T05:27:04.000Z,2025/4/26 00:00

So far, I have been very pleased.  Not only is the low-light capabilities worth the upgrade from the X4 alone, the replaceable lenses and improved workflow are outstanding.  (For me), this was a worthy upgrade from the X4.  Having said that, if I was a creator that shot exclusively in good light, the X4 would be just fine.  Trust me though, if you shoot in lower light or even at night, the X5 is probably 2 F-stops better at least if I were to guess...",5,,2025-04-26T17:55:40.000Z,2025-08-20T17:08:04.000Z,2025/4/26 00:00

The cameras on each side give you a complete 360 degree view of everything.  You can also use a traditional framing where it captures multiple views at the same time.  Then post event editing you can frame and choose the best video content.<br /><br />The unit is really beefy.  I attribute this to a huge battery.  The popular action camera competition is around 50 (bare bones) to 100 grams.  This camera is a hefty 200 grams, and thats because the battery is 2x as big as the competitor.  The bottom mount has a quick connect (accessory you have to buy) and also has a screw in base for a traditional mount such as a tripod.  I had thought about using this on a FPV or camera drone but the shape and weight make it not really a good choice in my opinion.<br /><br />The camera lens is replaceable with a tool, which is nice and if you do put this on a drone will likely get used. The tool and replacements are not included.  The picture made me think this came with a selfie stick, but it doesn't.  You will need to have a mobile (phone or tablet) device to get going with this. No phone? No go with camera.

This product is bad and seems rushed just like their other products. They use influencers to peddle their products and not through actual research and development imho.<br /><br />1. Issues with artifacts in the video. If you zoom in just a tiny bit you get either Jello in the footage or you get artifacts/noise. Or you can win the lotto and get both. The 3 new AI chips don't fix this and to be honest they should not be needed to FIX anything. If they gave you a good sensor and good glass, this would not happen. (Common sense) the scamfluencers on YouTube will NOT tell you. Also, if you zoom in 10/15% you get tons of blurry footage. Something to look forward to!<br /><br />2. Color science is off. It is a good improvement over the X4 tbh, but that doesn't mean much, because the X4 was awful as well.<br /><br />3. Audio: Actually, pretty decent improvement but who actually uses audio right from any device when you will put your own audio in it anyway?<br /><br />4. Customer service IS ABYSMAL! They are worse than DJI's customer service.<br /><br />5. You can't ask questions for support on their Facebook or reddit pages. They will ban you, which is unbelievable. That is why you see mostly positive on their, they remove the bad.<br /><br />6. Their application v.2 is awful. There are TONS of complaints online about this as well.

I don't consume my footage on a tiny screen, I enjoy it on an iPad or 4k screen. Phone screens do nothing for me.<br /><br />7. Night footage is BAD. Think the day footage is bad?

After proceeding, the camera froze for an extended period before rebooting. Since then, the camera has been consistently malfunctioning.

In most cases, the camera shuts down and restarts on its own, rendering it completely unusable for any practical purpose.<br />I contacted Insta360 support and was advised to return the unit to Hong Kong for inspection/repair, with shipping costs borne by me. This is highly unreasonable considering I paid $588.49 USD for this item, and an additional $70.00 USD to have it shipped to Jamaica via a courier service.

Seriously, though, the X5 is nothing less than AMAZING for my calm recordings of beautiful music. Even the built-in audio mics are up to the task, with a bit of help from the Izotope Ozone Elements audio mixing plugin for DaVinci Resolve Fairlight (I use the Warm Synth preset). It's absolutely wonderful to be able to place the tiny camera 1-2 inches from the keyboard, and it will capture the pianist as the main eye-strong subject with the flute and cello nicely framed as secondary subjects. The recordings are simply stunning - I film in ProRes 4K/30 at High bitrate, then edit in Resolve (not much editing needed). Even though the file size is huge (25GB for 5 min of music), the workflow is VERY smooth with my i5 PC and RTX 3080 graphics card. I look forward eagerly to doing more music recordings, as they yield beautiful video and audio. (The ProRes 422 footage is amazing before export - every little bit of quality helps.) I export in H.264, as there is a bit of quality loss with H.265. The resulting file for YouTube is around 2 GB, which is very reasonable.

I don't generate reviews with Al or accept freebies from companies just to write fluff pieces. With that out of the way...<br /><br />As someone who produces video content for both personaand commercial use, I've worked with nearly every major action and 360¬∞ camera system on the market. The Insta360 X5 is the first one that truly bridges the gap between convenience and professional-grade results.<br />Let's start with image quality. The 8K resolution paired with the bigger sensors delivers exceptionally clean footage, even in mixed lighting. I've used it for outdoor shoots, indoor interviews, and low-light environments, and the footage consistently holds up. Colors are accurate, dynamic range is surprisingly strong for a camera this size, and the PureVideo mode is a genuine leap forward in nighttime performance.<br />What really makes the X5 stand out, though, is the post-production flexibility. With 360 capture, I can shoot first and choose my framing later. Yes, it's basicly Insta360's slogan,<br />but it's a slogan that's actually true. This functionality (which is inherent in 360¬∞ cameras) is invaluable during run-and-gun shoots where reshoots aren't .an option. Insta360 Studio has matured into a powerful, reliable editing tool, and the mobile app is fast becoming a go-to when I need to deliver social-ready content quickly.<br /><br />Audio has also seen a big step up. The built-in micsare far more usable now, with better<br />clarity and less wind distortion-a major win for those of us tryiing to minimize gear on the<br />go.",5,,2025-05-11T06:09:11.000Z,2025-08-17T22:12:13.000Z,2025/5/10 00:00

Don't get one of these without doing similar research yourself.<br /><br />That said, it is very solidly built and works just as the online guides suggest it will. The controls aren't quite as intuitive as you might think, but there are a lot of settings; you should be able to figure out what works best for you without too much trouble.<br /><br />These can take weird, wild panorama videos, and you will see a lot of those out there. My main idea is to set it up to film me doing some involved task (repairs, cooking, etc.) and then ignore it while I do my thing. When I am done I can use the provided desktop app (which is better than I was expecting it to be) to visually aim (and zoom) the camera, including creating two-camera effects by duping the main file and creating a second version that I can 'cut' to and back from.<br /><br />If you've watched repair videos, you've probably seen people doing stuff clumsily with one hand while they shoot (shakey) video with the other. Oh, and then they turn off the camera when they need two hands for something which we never get to see. The Insta360 can be used in those cases by just plopping it where it can view the action and then you can aim and zoom in post, and smoothly.<br /><br />Not mentioned in the reviews and videos I saw was the simple protective case that comes with the camera. You can zip it over the camera even while it is mounted to a stick or tripod and it will protect the lenses from careless handling.

Man, I am so glad I waited for this generation. It is so easy to use. It comes on quickly. It records quickly. I'm not going to go through the specs because you can look at those. And I am not an in-depth reviewer but you have probably been looking at videos from them as well. But I will tell you a few of my observations so far.<br /><br />I really like the way it deletes the selfie stick from the footage. I added a Falcam quick release plate to the bottom. This makes it a snap to put it on the end of a 48"" stick and I am glad I am not screwing it on and off each time because I would be afraid of fiddling with it and dropping it. I also got an orange wrist strap and have it attached to the Falcam plate. So I am glad I have the strap because again, I am afraid of dropping this expensive Snickers bar on the ground, but the wrist strap does show in the footage.<br /><br />Also, I was surprised how warm it gets when charging and recording. Even on a regular-temperature day or indoors, there is a good bit of heat coming off of this. I had to learn that it is still putting off heat when it is sleeping. So I have gotten used to shutting it down before putting it back in its little neoprene zipper sleeve. It is nothing so bad that it has stopped recording, but I wish there was a way to manage it because I am concerned about the long-term effects of heat on the electronics and the battery. I don't know that I would want to do the constant recording with overwrite mode in 6k in the summer because that would just keep adding heat in an already hot environment.<br /><br />I bought the SanDisk Extreme Pro V30 card under the advice from some forum on Reddit. It has performed very well and is not too expensive. I thought I would need a V60 or V90 card like I did in my mirrorless, but you actually can't use those. So just a really well performing V30 is all you need. Insta360 provides a list of",5,,2025-05-13T22:21:30.000Z,2025-08-11T19:16:05.000Z,2025/5/10 00:00

There is actually a lot of good information on there and some helpful tutorials in the app and on the website. There is also a really active community and I have gotten some good pointers from them.<br /><br />I also really like the option that the first two and last two seconds of the footage can automatically be trimmed off. This is not something I would have expected to like so much, but when I have this on a selfie stick, those moments are just garbage footage anyway. Now I can actually show someone a clip right away and it seems like a much cleaner clip.<br /><br />Editing on the phone in the app is kind of a process but I'm glad it is possible. The only thing is, it eats up quite a bit of space to move the 360 footage over to my phone to make editing smoother. I have not played with proxy recording yet, but this may help keep the footage on the card in the camera and still be able to edit on my phone. I also have had a pretty full phone, data-wise. So just today I made a lot of space on it so that I have some room to do more editing. But if I were on vacation, I don't know how much space on my phone I would want to eat up with this every session.<br /><br />The editing program has so much going on. I wish it was more straightforward. It gives the option to do an AI edit, but I tried it a couple of times and did not like the results. Too much of me in the footage. The fact is, when I am recording, I am basically just waving this camera around, but the things that are actually getting my attention are not necessarily standing out to the AI editor. So as I am just starting out, I am sticking with keyframe editing. Fortunately, this was easier than I thought once I got the hang of it. You basically just pause the video, move the view to what you want, add a keyframe, and then let it play till the next desired reframing, then repeat the process. Then the program does an excellent job of lining these up in a way that flows so that i",5,,2025-05-13T22:21:30.000Z,2025-08-11T19:16:05.000Z,2025/5/10 00:00

Once I get more of this basic editing under my belt I will move on to some of the apps more dynamic transitions and effects.<br /><br />This camera still gets people's attention. And I just received the 10' selfie stick I ordered, so I'm sure I will be getting even more footage of people looking at it. I also bought a silicone lens cover. It just did not feel right to set it down on a surface right on the lens, and standing it up just seems like I am asking for it to fall on the lens. So the cover gives me piece of mind. I like the little zipper pouch Insta360 includes, and was happy that it stretches to fit the camera with the lens cover on. I plan on ordering a metal cage as well, mostly for the protection, but also kind of hoping it helps keep it cool. I also ordered a screen protector.<br /><br />So far it has been a ton of fun. And it has been really cool looking at the shot ideas other content creators have come up with over the last few years. One shout out to Luke Edwin.

I think it took them nearly 2 years just to go from X3 to X4?? The upgrades they did include that seemed kinda minor actually make a huge difference when I'm shooting<br /><br />Daylight shooting looks largely the same on X5 as it did on X4‚Äîsharp, crisp, vibrant, and really smooth. But once the sunlight disappears, you immediately notice how much the bigger sensor improved its low light performance. I think the low light quality is on par with typical point-and-shoot cams, which is wild since 360 action cams notoriously perform poorly in low light situations!<br /><br />And then there's the sound quality, which I think has always been one of my pain points with Insta360s.

I look forward to bringing it along with me on my various adventures and I can trust it is going to help me create some spectacular videos! Highly recommended!",5,,2025-05-16T23:39:51.000Z,2025-08-16T17:37:40.000Z,2025/5/10 00:00
1,1 - US,1,421,gl_camera,B0F5QKYDH7,B0DZCBYCNY,76110516051,Awesome 360 camera! Very impressed so far! Definitely THE BEST 360 camera available currently.,"So far I have been very impressed with the new X5. I own the previous model (X4) and the X5 has really stepped it up and made a lot of improvements over the previous model. Perhaps the biggest improvements that I care about the most are the improved low light performance, the ability to replace damaged lenses yourself, rather than having to send the camera out for repair, the improved microphone/audio quality and the functionality improvements to the single lens mode. Thanks to the larger sensors the X5 is able to provide improved low light performance. It is also utilizing 3 AI chips to render the brightest image with the least amount of noise as possible. Overall the image is much brighter on the X5 than the previous X4 model but thanks to the new ""Pure Video"" mode you're getting the absolute best low light image quality to date from a 360 camera! A big issue with 360 cameras are that the lenses are very susceptible to damage and using lens guards to attempt to protect them will often severely lower the image quality. The Insta360 X5 remedies this issue by introducing replaceable lenses! Previously, you had to send in your camera to have damaged lenses repaired which would lead to weeks of down time not being able to use your camera. With the new X5 replaceable lenses, Insta360 is offering lens repair kits for $30 (each lens) that allow you to remove the damaged lens and replace it with a new lens. You can do this in the comfort of your own home or on location. No need to send your camera out for repair! From my understanding it is very simple and it only take about 30-45 mins. Very cool, no more down time! The microphone on the previous X4 was already very good and now the mics on the X5 are even better! The redesigned X5 mesh guard acts like a windscreen for the mice and reduces the amount of wind noise affecting the audio of the camera. I don't use the single lens mode often on the X5 but I really like the improved functionality that Insta360 has brought to it ",5,,2025-05-16T23:39:51.000Z,2025-08-16T17:37:40.000Z,2025/5/10 00:00

My plan was NOT to use it as an action camera but more for b-roll production.  I am going to keep it for that.<br />However, upon researching, I found that this is not an 8k camera sinc e the individual sensors are 4k.  The problem is tht you don't use the whole sensor.  The design dictates a circle inscribed on a 4k sensor.  So you're loosing 20% or more of the light sensitive area.  So you're really down to about 2.7k.  That's okay and still useful until you realize that for production you'll need to push in on that realestate and crop your shots.  So typically you're now down to 1.8 k or so.<br />This unit gets VERY hot and goes through batteries quickly.<br />Still, I don't know of anything else that has the design capability of this camera.  Think about how you're going to use it..before you use it.",2,,2025-05-16T22:23:17.000Z,2025-08-07T15:22:32.000Z,2025/5/10 00:00

Coming from an x2, there‚Äôs a noticeable jump in image quality and build quality. The full resolution and frame rate isn‚Äôt always available though, depending on what mode you are in, or what image enhancements you got. It does well though. Low light performance is good, though you can see some artifacting using clear image at night if you‚Äôre using it for car stuff. I noticed passing trees and light poles gave them a kind of trailing pixelation as they passed by. I thought that was unfortunate at first, but after using the footage, I kind of preferred that to kind of enhance motion blur and give a real enhancement on speed.<br /><br />Replaceable lenses are thankfully finally a thing, super happy about that. Battery life in certain modes can be dragged out, which is good because the x2 had kind of weak runtime. If you‚Äôre going from an x4, I‚Äôd imagine the juice may not be worth the squeeze for most people, but from an x2 it‚Äôs worth it.",5,,2025-05-17T05:57:34.000Z,2025-08-04T12:17:06.000Z,2025/5/17 00:00

The only 360 camera I had was the 2017 Samsung gear 360 and this camera is a million times better.  I have each of the dji osmo pockets and have been using those for several years, the gear 360 technology wasn't where it needed to be at that time so I just gave up on it and stuck to gopros and then the osmo pockets. The problem I have is all the years of footage I have, I'm rarely in the video. So I really wanted to try a newer version of the 360 cameras and this one is in my opinion perfect. This technology has come a long way. Stitching the videos together at lightning speeds is insane. The video quality is insane. The battery life is great.  Being able to use the app and basically be the cameraman and go through and pan and zoom and get the shots you want is absolutely amazing. There's no way I have learned everything this camera is capable of yet, but so far is has blown me away. I took it to the lake today and it fit in my front pocket easily, so I like the size even though its a little bigger and heavier than my osmo pockets. I love how it captures absolutely everything, no worrying about missing shots, for the technology, robust construction, being waterproof and video/image quality, this camera is well worth the price. The dome lens covers and battery are replaceable, I really like that. I plan on taking this up mountains and who knows where else, and knowing that the critical parts are replaceable gives me peace of mind. Plus I can keep a spare battery on deck if I run out of juice.  Oh! And the camera is very simple to use, I didn't read up on anything, just powered it on and was able to go through all of the settings with ease. I also was able to download the app and use it on a s25 ultra with no problems. Has a stable wifi connection as well. I am amazed by this camera each time I use it. Might have to sell the osmo pockets off. W",5,,2025-05-19T06:59:01.000Z,2025-08-17T16:57:04.000Z,2025/5/17 00:00

I sent the X4 in for repair and also upgraded to the X5, hoping it would not happen with the new one.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the exact same issue occurred with the X5.

You can also export in 360 degree view for use on VR headsets, this is the part that blows my mind.  I can watch on my VR headset the videos that I recorded, and just turn myself around in a circle, and my position in the video moves as well, as if I was really there while I'm watching it.<br /><br />I had an experience which gives the perfect example of why this camera is so beneficial over regular action cameras. I was on a cruise attending their midnight party where they do a balloon drop. My wife was next to me and was Face Timing her brother, watching the balloons get tossed around.  Her brother started being silly and tossing things in the air pretending he was there with us tossing balloons.  Unbeknownst to us, there were two women behind us watching the facetime call, laughing and pointing to my wife's phone, and waving at her brother.  We didn't see any of this going on, but her brother told us later on about the women having fun with him.<br /><br />I decided to go back to the video I recorded, and swiped my finger to see what was going on behind me, and sure enough, I was able to see the entire thing transpire, simply because this camera records 360 degrees.  This immediately won me over, and I am now an Instacam360 lover for life.<br /><br />The only warning I would give is keep in mind a video recorded in 5K30, which means it's slightly better than 4K and is recording at 30 frames per second, doesn't mean the exported video will be in 5k.  It's more like 2.5k, as the front camera is 2.5k, and the rear camera is 2.5k, for a total of 5k.  This means if you export video from only one camera, it's not going to be the quality you're expecting.  If you're able to, I would definitely suggest recording in 8K, but just keep in mind the camera gets very hot when doing this, and if you're already in a hot place, the camera can overheat and shut down.  8K works much better when you're in a cold room.<br /><br />If you've never ow",5,,2025-06-08T04:47:09.000Z,2025-08-16T17:54:19.000Z,2025/6/7 00:00

This camera ensures that never happens again.<br /><br />This camera has two 180 degree cameras back to back, and records video from both of them simultaneously, stitching together the video from both cameras.  If you use one of the ""invisible selfie sticks"", the camera digitally removes the selfie stick from the video making your videos look like they're taken from a drone. While Insta360 sells ""invisible selfie sticks"" and claims that only theirs work to remove the selfie stick, there are some generic ones on Amazon that also work just as well.<br /><br />You don't need experience to edit your recordings, Insta360 has several videos on how to edit your videos like a pro, and they're easy to follow. I suggest the first thing you do is insert a Micro-SD card, hit record, and hold the X5 up in the air for a minute, maybe if you can, just walk around somewhere with it.<br /><br />When you play the video back, just slide your finder on the screen up, down, left, or right, and it will pan on the screen as if you were literally pointing a camera in that direction. You'll never have to worry about where to point the camera ever again.<br /><br />Editing in Insta360 Studio is a breeze; you open your recorded videos, and then click an icon to add what's called a ""key frame"" to the timeline. A keyframe is just a dot placed on the timeline which tells Insta360 Studio to change something on the video at the selected point in time on the timeline; it is not required to use them for the record.<br /><br />Examples of things you might change are changing the direction the camera is virtually pointed, changing picture settings like color intensity, brightness, or adding special affects, it's very simple.

I thought I'd start using this by installing the app on my phone and testing it on some work recently done on my house by placing it on a tripod while crews were working.  One video completely failed to record and stopped after 4 seconds.  The second video was a time lapse, which stopped after about 1.5 hours (while plugged into a charger), the resulting video was early 2000's GRAINY pixelation.  The third video was of a pool installation, which again stopped after 1.5 hours.<br /><br />The device relies on your cell phone way too much for my tastes.  Lots of the functionality is based on the phone app.<br /><br />The positives:<br />360 camera was interesting, we'll have to play with it more, but I'm hoping to get this on some roller coasters this summer with my family.  I'll need to make sure it's set up in advance, since fiddling with the app is a royal pain.  I think I'm being generous with the 4 stars after the produced results, but I'd like to give it more time before I update the rating again.<br /><br />Maybe this is meant for more of the streamer crowd, where they invest more time into working with and understanding the equipment's function and capabilities.

If you need a vlogging camera, this could be a good option. I bought it as an addition to my other cameras to get unique footage in scenic locations.

I also did a short test in a dimly lit parking lot and that turned out far better than the fireworks. Overall, it's a good camera. I found the PC software far easier to use than the phone app. Hopefully I can figure that out soon so I can put up some short clips.

The footage captured at night is often incredibly noisy, lacking detail, and riddled with motion blur, even with minimal movement. Dealing with these massive 8K files becomes a constant struggle, as they quickly consume storage space, and the specialized, often buggy, editing software struggles immensely to salvage any usable quality from the poor night footage. Despite being waterproof, the camera's overall fragility makes me hesitant to even risk taking it out for night adventures, fearing it won't survive a minor bump in the dark. Its ""easy to use"" claim is misleading; setting up decent night shots requires extensive manual adjustments that are incredibly difficult and time-consuming, often requiring multiple frustrating attempts. Furthermore, while stabilization is present, it frequently creates weird artifacts or completely fails in low-light, dynamic situations, resulting in shaky, distorted, or even nauseating footage that's unusable. These large, poor-quality files quickly fill storage and make editing a chore, as rendering and exporting take an eternity, only to yield disappointing results.",2,,2025-07-09T04:23:05.000Z,2025-08-20T07:12:59.000Z,2025/7/5 00:00

The camera truly excels in capturing stunning photos and videos with remarkable detail and vibrant colors that seem ahead of their time. The ability to connect it to my wheelchair using extension clips and sticks while being able to preview everything in 360 degrees on my phone is a game-changer. The visual quality, particularly in 8K, is nothing short of spectacular, showcasing the potential of advanced imaging technology. The battery life holds up pretty long as well if not exposed to the heat long. Inside I left it on record for over 4 hours before the battery started blinking, but outside in the Florida heat, the battery got too hot and it shut down after about two hours.<br /><br />However, my enthusiasm was dampened by several significant drawbacks. The process of converting files, navigating the cloud system, and ensuring WiFi connectivity has proven to be quite cumbersome. Unfortunately, the limited editing capabilities and challenges in sharing content on platforms like YouTube and social media have made the experience frustrating.

It‚Äôs disheartening to feel that such a state-of-the-art device struggles with essential tasks that should enhance the overall experience. Ultimately, while the Insta360 X5 has extraordinary potential, it currently falls short in delivering a seamless user experience. Until Insta360 addresses the shortcomings of its cloud system, enhances the editing capabilities, improves conversion processes, and simplifies the uploading procedures to ensure compatibility with YouTube and other prominent social media platforms, I am unable to recommend the Insta360 product.

We purchased a carbon fiber 10' selfie stick which is incredible, but I would say you'd at least want one that could go to 6'.  For most things, the further you get away the better perspective the shot will bring.<br />This technological wonder is full of cool features and options.  Lots of video quality settings which impact size vs frame rate etc.  So many post processing options.  Once you have a 360 video recorded - you can re-create your final product by changing the views throughout the video either by using for example AI tracking to follow a face or by adjusting the view throughout the video manually.<br />The downside of this capability is that there is post processing work that you need to take time to do to get the output.  I've currently got a lot of footage that I just don't have time to work with.<br />The size is reasonable - especially as you attach it to the top of a selfie stick anyway - the tall form factor works well.<br />Removable battery and removable / replaceable lenses are great features of this generation.  I now have several spare batteries for lots of recording hours between charges.<br />10meter water proof robustness is great - I've taken it on several white rafting trips as well as snorkeling and it has worked great.  (Floating selfie stick recommended!)<br />There are tons of accessories becoming available.  I got some cheap Poly Carbonate lens protectors which got scuffed quickly, but work good as a protector when we're not using the camera.  However even without protection I've felt the curved/exposed lenses are pretty strong and with this design they can be replaced if you do damage them.  And you can just do it yourself vs having to send it in.<br />We took the camera on a big trip and were able to selectively use it to document specia",5,,2025-08-09T13:35:30.000Z,2025-08-10T15:23:32.000Z,2025/8/9 00:00

It's a 360 camera, so it shoots video or still images of the entire 360 field of view. What this means is that you can reframe your images and videos later pointing the camera in any direction you want after you have taken the photos. This allows for some incredbile imagery that you cannot get in any other way.<br /><br />It has many built-in shooting modes, one of my favorites is the time lapse where you can shoot some amazing videos over hours and get some very cinematic videos of outdoor scenes. With the 8K image quality, I can shoot vides of action scenes like mountain biking, and export still images from the videos ensuring I do not miss any of the action.<br /><br />The included free software has a bit of a learning curve, but once you learn the basics you can quickly edit any images or videos. The software works on phones, tablets and they even have a more advances desktop version.<br /><br />I've also owned the previous versions of the Insta360 camera including the X2 and X4. The biggest upgrade to this X5 version other than the 8K resolution is the user replaceable lenses. This is a big deal since previously you would have to mail the camera back to the company and pay a hefty fee for a lens replacement.

Don't overlook that second part of my question though, experience editing videos is absolutely essential to get the most out of this camera. You can either edit them through the insta360 app or download the computer editing software which I'd recommend if you want to make videos with multiple clips and anything longer than 30 seconds. I find the software very intuitive being experienced with Adobe Premiere Pro but I would never recommend this camera to the average person because of the work involved.<br /><br />I'd bought the motorcycle bundle to use on my Waverunner (it was so dope) but at the very least get a bundle that comes with the action selfie stick as it's basically an essential component to handling the X5. Even just a little bit of use the X5 becomes very warm to the touch so using the stick is recommended for comfortable use.",5,,2025-06-30T12:31:04.000Z,2025-08-24T01:08:38.000Z,2025/6/28 00:00
