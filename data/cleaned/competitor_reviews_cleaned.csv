There is no solution to this, as it seems to be a problem with the Logitech driver, which is now ancient. I thought it was my computer, and then I bought a new one. Same issue. It is still being sold as a 4k camera, so I decided to post this review. The camera will only connect at USB 2.0 speeds on Windows 11. I was looking for 4k support and Windows Hello support as my primary needs. I ordered a cheap $60 Chinese camera for my work computer and it meets all my needs at less than half the price. The Windows Hello facial recognition works much better than on the Brio. Don't buy this if you're on Windows 11, because you only get 1080P and Logitech clearly hopes that you don't notice.

When I was ordering the item, I ordered it as a new item and not used. Hence, I consider this a rather fraudulent thing to happen on the Amazon platform.
