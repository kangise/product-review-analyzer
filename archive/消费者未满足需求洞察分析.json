  "消费者未满足需求洞察": {
    "总结": "产品在硬件可靠性、软件兼容性和客户服务质量方面存在严重缺陷，导致用户体验严重受损，急需在产品质量控制和技术支持方面进行根本性改进。",
    "技术角度": "硬件可靠性是最大痛点，设备频繁出现连接断开、死机、过热等问题，平均使用寿命不到一年。关键论据：'it died in year one (9 months) from new'、'stopped working out of nowhere'、'Continually froze after a couple of minutes'、'it kept disconnecting'等反复出现的硬件故障投诉。",
    "功能角度": "软件兼容性问题严重影响用户体验，特别是与Mac系统、Windows 11和主流视频会议软件的兼容性问题。关键论据：'software doesn't work on Mac'、'doesn't work with Windows 11'、'software conflicts with MS Teams'、'buggy menus that prevented accessing settings'等软件功能缺陷。",
    "场景角度": "产品在专业会议和内容创作等核心使用场景下表现不稳定，无法满足用户对可靠性的基本期望。关键论据：'can't even use as a webcam'、'Turns off during every conference call'、'I was without a camera for about 2 weeks'等在关键使用场景下的失效问题。"
