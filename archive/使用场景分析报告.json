        "Honestly loved the camera, but it stopped working one day. Calling the support line, I was told that with the newest update to Windows 11, it's just not going to work and it was suggested I go into my computer to downgrade back to windows 10 to make it functional. Support did not offer any other way to help so for now the webcam is useless for me.",
        "This $200 camera was recommended by the NYTimes and this is the first time the Wirecutter has seriously let me down. The extra features are annoying, not awesome. But the biggest problem is that it just doesn't work. It's inconsistent when I am on Zoom or recording podcasts with Riverside. It takes too much memory and recently recorded my audio and video with a 2 second delay so I had to re-do an entire episode. It works about 70% of the time. Avoid at all costs.",
        "Bought this on a recommendation for a quality camera to record videos for social, can't even use as a webcam, let alone a shoot. Turns off during every conference call; have to unplug it and plug back in for video to maybe come back up. Tried plugging in via their cable to Lenovo docking station, Lenovo laptop or Lenovo monitor USB in and get same result each and every port. Missed return window. Going to plug the logi back in.",
        "This is a perfect clean webcam. The picture quality is excellent to make Teams or Zoom Call. Only problem is, sometimes it doesn't follow your face correctly. In that case you have to unplug it, leave it unplug for 15 seconds, and plug it back in. This happen once a while.",
        "Have had this product for years without a problem and one day it magically stops working on me so I decided to reorder another, my 2 up-to-date PC’s were not able to recognize either of them. I see it as it has become obsolete since its successors are out. I loved this product for everything it advertised but it’s nothing but a cash grab now.<br /><br />Stay away!!!! Buy the link 2 or obs bot tiny 2"

        "Everyone on zoom spontaneously comments on the improved video.",
        "I make some YouTube videos and I have a number of webcams including a Panasonic Lumix camera and a Logitech Brio camera.  This little camera beats all of them. the picture is remarkably sharp, the auto focus is way better than all of my other cameras and it has a gimbal allowing me to adjust its field of view.  In addition it has an AI feature that can keep your face or entire body in view automatically.  I was pleanstly surprised. They also lowered the price a little since there is a newer version the InstaLink 2 but it is no better than this one and I prefer the form factor of this model.",
        "Great cam! Love the different modes on this cam, can control with hand movements if you want to. Easy to learn how to use and the only part that I struggled with was getting updates sometimes but that’s because I’m not very tech oriented. Just make sure that you always search and update your firmware and you will not have any issues with this cam. Beautiful picture quality can go 4K and beyond. I do recommend using some light rings with the cam in order to get the best possible picture quality because normally rooms are too dark. I, for example, use one light box and two ring lights. That gives ample light for streaming."

        "The Insta360 Link PTZ 4K Webcam is absolutely phenomenal. I use it for my Skype calls during my Portuguese lessons, and I constantly get compliments on the video quality. The pan/tilt, auto-tracking, zoom, and whiteboard mode are crazy good—making it feel like a high-end studio setup. The built-in mic is also worlds better than a standard laptop mic, which is a huge plus. If you’re looking to step up your Zoom or video call game, this webcam is 100% worth the price.",
        "My daughter purchased this for me, as I am a volunteer tutor who aids adults to pass their GED on line via my computer.  Even though it stopped working,  their tech representatives made it ease to send back at no charge and no quibble repairs made.  It’s a great camera that you can also use a whiteboard for presentations to students.  Buy this, you won’t be disappointed!",
        "This product deserves more than a 1-star rating; its capabilities, ease of use, top-end features, and benefits, make this a great choice if they have a great or even a good Customer Service Dept.  Please read more…<br /><br />Work requires multiple Zoom meetings daily and I needed a new webcam. The Link had great online reviews and several flattering online videos. It arrived at my doorstep on February 1, 2025; by the 3rd, it was up and running, by the 5th, my enthusiasm started to fade. The camera feature started disconnecting regularly, and I noticed that I needed to unplug and replug the USB-C cable to get the camera to reconnect. Notice that I didn't say the 360 Link - just the camera. Only 3 things could be wrong, the firmware or app needed updating, a setting on my laptop must be changed, or this device is defective. I called Insta360 at their official line: 800-692-0360. This is where the nightmare began...<br /><br />Folks, if you're still with me this far, please read other \"1-Star\" reviews, and you'll find the camera can disengage and customer service can’t help. The Insta360 Link consistently dropped video capability every time the laptop came out of sleep mode or if I switched from Zoom to Teams. Insta360 CSRs did not have an immediate solution for this frustrating problem on February 5th, so they sent multiple emails requesting more information each time with no resolution. Three whole weeks of emails, 20 days, and four 1-hour plus phone calls, with no answers. Their solution...? Mail the device to them, they'll repair it and send it back to me within 2-3 weeks. Was this a joke? This is a brand-new device with less than 30 days of use. Did I mention I'm on Zoom daily! I decided to return the device for a new one instead. Sorry for the lengthy review, but I needed to be very clear on my experience with Insta360.",
        "So I'm overall happy with the purchase and comparables around the same price don't offer much better. I'm happy with the crispy video and some of the advanced features are natively recognized by windows camera app like smart whiteboard and following the speaker focusing on face.<br /><br />The part i was disappointed in was the audio, with or without noise cancelling you can get better audio out of a 50 dollar Sennheiser usb headset (sc 30 ml) than this.<br /><br />All in all, 4 starts, I'm keeping it and I'll probably upgrade to a full on video camera because this seems to be about the top of the line for usb webcams that aren't DSLR or Mirrorless",
        "I’ve been using the Insta360 Link 2C for a while now, and it’s hands down the best webcam I’ve tried. The 4K video quality is incredibly sharp, making a huge difference in Zoom calls and recordings. The AI-powered tracking is smooth and actually useful—it keeps me perfectly centered even when I move around during Zoom calls.<br /><br />I bought it as a substitution of my phone-as-camera and it works well.<br /><br />What really stands out is the low-light performance. Unlike other webcams that struggle in dim lighting, this one keeps the image clear and well-exposed without looking grainy. The autofocus is quick, and the different modes, like DeskView and Whiteboard, add a lot of versatility.<br /><br />It’s definitely on the expensive side, but for the quality and features, I think it’s worth it. If you want a high quality webcam that just works flawlessly, this is a solid choice."

        "[update]:  reminder - they only expect it to work for a year, since the warranty is only 12 months.<br /><br />after 2 years of ownership:<br /><br />it died in year one (9 months) from new (unresponsive, blue light only).  I had to ship it back, it was replaced.  dealing with support to get an RMA was relatively easy.  I was without a camera for about 2 weeks from failure, contact, ship to them, inspect, return shipping.<br /><br />it died again, in year two (14 months after first replacement).  support has been _significantly worse_ to work with so far.  after 10 days of excessive hassle dealing with support, they.....declared it out of warranty.",

        "Was hoping this would be better than my logitech  4k pro. Its got better tech but the picture is slightly worse. Its great if you are 2ft from the webcam but if using it for anything else (like making YT videos where you also need to screenshare or are 3-4ft back the color makes your skin look weird and its super pixilated. I tried to return but come to find out they have a 15 day policy vs a 30 day  - if they believe in their product seems strange to not offer the standard 30 days.  I even asked if i could exchange for something that was 3x more expensive and pay the difference as the camera is literally brand new and in the box. NOPE."
