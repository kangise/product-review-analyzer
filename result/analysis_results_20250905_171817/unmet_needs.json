        "Camera stopped working 1 day into vacation in Mexico. Camera only went 12\" under water with all access ports fully closed! Very frustrating when buy a \"waterproof\" camera for vacation",
        "I bought it (new) and it worked fine, I had used it indoors for tests like if it works and all the modes and it was fine, I went on a trip 2 weeks ago and i took it with, recorded fir 30 minutes maybe and it turned off and never turned on again",
        "This is great if you like to buy a new one every year, that's about how long it lasts before it starts glitching and then quits all together",
        "Been enjoying my camera since January, 360 shits tell me why shit wait 6 flipping months and decided not to turn anymore",

        "Fun camera but horrible app! If they don't fix the Insta360 app soon. I will return it!!! The app is sluggish and keeps crashing",
        "Camera has cool features it's too bad the app is so terrible that it makes editing almost imposible. I've had my camera for a week and been trying to edit and upload the same video for days",

        "Great camera, awful apps. I bought the camera and took it on a trip… The desktop software is basically useless—it crashes or throws errors when trying to load a simple 3-minute video",
        "After three hours I haven't been able to take a single image with it. The frustration of linking the camera to my cell device, then to my PC then being made to download apps to everything and still can't use the camera"

        "My main frustration stems from its abysmal low-light performance, particularly with 8K files. The footage captured at night is often incredibly noisy, lacking detail, and riddled with motion blur"
