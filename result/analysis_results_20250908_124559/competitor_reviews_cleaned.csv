I tried to contact DJI and getting it replaced but they wanted me to mail it back before giving me any kind of quote or time frame that I won't have my camera. It made me nervous I was going to get sick with a huge bill before they would agree to return my camera. The crack wasn't that bad and the screen is usable, just not water proof anymore.. I would've thought an action camera could handle a small drop.",3
1,B0B7X2JXND,2025-04-11T13:06:53.000Z,"Le pongo 3 estrellas porque la caja vino incompleta. Le faltaron: 2 protectores de lente de goma, 2 tornillos de bloqueo, y 1 adaptador de liberación rápida (según la descripción si los trae). Luego la cámara con sus baterías funciona perfecto.",3
1,B0B7X2JXND,2025-04-11T23:08:39.000Z,"Buena calidad, imagen muy estable y fluida",5
1,B0B7X2JXND,2025-04-15T02:49:01.000Z,I got this for dji camera for recording barrel racing vidos I am new at this so I am learning about the camera not sure yet if it going to do what I want but it is a grate camera,5

1,B0B7X2JXND,2025-06-16T00:29:27.000Z,Cameras constantly struggling with focus and accurate color,1
1,B0B7X2JXND,2025-06-18T21:17:48.000Z,"The product was easy to setup with no issues. After using the Dji osmo action 3 and testing it with a full charge battery. The video and audio recording quality was perfect for my liking, However the Dji osmo action 3 overheated and the camera turn off on 11 percent battery in a hot weather.",4
1,B0B7X2JXND,2025-06-24T20:42:26.000Z,"Tras haberla usado durante 4 meses puedo decir con certeza de que es un excelente producto, me encantó desde la primera vez, la calidad de video es muy buena, su estabilización y demás funciones, además con sus tres baterías me da una autonomía mucho mayor, tenía miedo de que tenga el problema de desenfoque como lo tuvo las primeras unidades que salieron al mercado Pero parece que ya han solucionado ese problema, al precio que lo compré fue una completa ganga, en definitiva se los recomiendo 10/10",5
1,B0B7X2JXND,2025-08-15T15:40:49.000Z,"Excelente, compacta, tiene buena imagen y grabación de audio. No es muy buena para fotos, pero el video y la estabilización son muy buenos.",5

1,B0B7X2LXQ6,2025-04-12T22:22:16.000Z,"I’ve now used this camera a few times, and am happy with the purchase. I knew it was an older generation, so wasn’t expecting cinema quality.<br /><br />I will say, in low light conditions with Horizon Stabilization turned on, there is some artifacting. But that’s to be expected with the mode I was in.<br /><br />All in all, I am happy with this purchase and look forward to recording more of my bike rides with it.<br /><br />Attached image is a screenshot of a video frame. I’m on cell service so can’t upload a sample video.",4
1,B0B7X2LXQ6,2025-05-04T23:44:31.000Z,"Excelente cámara para iniciar, full imagen y estabilidad, para el precio estoy feliz",5
1,B0B7X2LXQ6,2025-06-05T10:52:05.000Z,I'm very happy. I've used it for about three months now. It's main use is to video riding the dirt bike. Great quality video. Over very happy. Bought cheap action cameras but decided to spend the money and got this. Was not disappointed.,5
1,B0B7X2LXQ6,2025-06-16T22:23:27.000Z,"Excelente cámara, tiene un estabilizador excelente",5
1,B0B7X2LXQ6,2025-07-11T17:09:42.000Z,"Why did you pick this product vs others?:<br />They force you to use the app and the app is unsafe, check the online discussions, returning for a GoPro instead.",1
1,B0B7X2LXQ6,2025-08-12T16:08:05.000Z,Great Action Camera for a bargain compared to the new model action 5 or go pro 13 great for everything except low light I'd recommend the newer models for that.  I'm using mine for a motorcycle poetry vlog I have on you tube and the stabilization works perfectly I don't think you can go wrong with this camera check out footage shot on this camera on my you tube  www.youtube.com/@tsummerspoetry,5
1,B0C783J9WC,2025-06-08T23:07:54.000Z,"Well, made the mistake of not checking this when it arrived so it's just over a month now since it arrived.  Got everything charged last night in prep for a long bike ride today.  Mounted the camera, downloaded the app, then turned the camera on to sync with the DJI Mimi and saw the camera menu screen briefly, then nothing but black.  Same for front and back.  Cycled through all the batteries and on one occasion I got the camera on long enough to do a factory reset.  Thought that solved the problem because afterward the camera screen turned on but after just a few minutes, it went black again.  Tried all the normal tricks - swapped batteries; left the battery out for 10-mins, swapped simcards, cycled on/off my Iphone and finally deleted and reinstalled the DJI app.  Finally, got online and after 30-mins with DJI online support (total waste of time as the tech couldn't understand why I couldn't access the camera menu, even after I repeatedly told him the screen was black) he sent me a link to basically send the camera in for repair.  I'm not sure if it'll be under warranty or not.  My bet is it won't be and the repair will be more than I paid for the unit.  I have always inspected any electronics as soon as I get them and the one time I didn't, I get burned.",1
1,B0C783J9WC,2025-04-10T09:58:26.000Z,"I bought the Osmo Action 4 to replace my GoPro Hero 11, and it completely blew my mind. It outperforms the GoPro in every way, including low light performance.<br /><br />I love how easy it is to attach the mount to the camera, and the front touchscreen is a great bonus. I primarily use it for my travel videos—whether it's mounted in my car or in rainy conditions, I can rely on it without worrying about weatherproofing, unlike my usual camera.<br /><br />I’m definitely looking forward to getting another one!",5
1,B0C783J9WC,2025-04-14T21:09:56.000Z,"Nice stabilization; battery length is adequate (I bought the combo with 2 additional batteries); the standard setting is just too wide for my purposes; I prefer the narrow mode (which is still a wide angle).  The design and weight makes this a stable platform; it doesn't feel cheap.  It should have come with a protective case or at least a lens protector, which is why I'm not giving it 5 stars.  The video is clear.",4
1,B0C783J9WC,2025-04-17T00:30:44.000Z,The camera came missing essential screws to actually lock in place magnetic rod and other attachments. The protective cover lens came cracked. The insides were also corroded with a white powder. When I would put battery inside to turn camera on in would begin to overheat but wouldn’t turn on.,1
1,B0C783J9WC,2025-04-19T01:33:48.000Z,"Beautiful image quality, with unbelievable motion stabilization- there will never be a need for tripods with functions like this!<br /><br />DJI has pulled my recommendation away from GoPro until something really big changes in terms of value for the money.<br /><br />The value of the entire DJI ecosystem is what makes this little guy the MVP on an indie video producers' team.<br /><br />Functionality Checklist:<br />Super lightweight, with no need for waterproof housing.<br />Shock case makes vertical videos easy.<br />Pairing with wireless mics? Easy.<br />Compatibility with other accessories? Mega easy.<br />Setting advanced color modes & profiles? Yup, also a piece of cake.<br />Image stabilization? So many modes, you could attach it to the top of a roomba, and it would look like a $1M dolly shot- still in 4k at 120 fps.<br />Slow motion for days.<br />Easy log profiles for flat color output.<br />Decent in-camera audio for the casual vlog or family production on social media.<br /><br />The one limitation I have found is letting the camera dunk a little too deeply in saltwater for a little too long.<br /><br />Clearly I'm not the only person saying this.<br /><br />But man, what an exciting time to be making content!",5
1,B0C783J9WC,2025-04-21T17:35:04.000Z,"THIS CAMERA REQUIRES YOU DOWNLOAD A DATA COLLECTION APP TO USE. When you buy a product you should expect to be able to use it. Instead, DJI holds your product hostage until you download their app on your phone. They ""alllow"" you to use the camera 5 times without downloading the app, proving the app is not necessary for use. They want to show you ads, and they want to mine your phones data. What if I don't have a smartphone? What if I don't want your app? I paid 300+ dollars for a camera that bricks itself unless you give in to this companies demands. This is disgusting",1
1,B0C783J9WC,2025-04-24T20:36:06.000Z,"Poor interaction with windows 11, go with a GoPro.  Additional codec needed.  About 40% of images are corrupt on tne camera before trying to transfer.  I likely have a defective camera, as so many seem to like this brand and model.  Used several SD cards with no luck",1
1,B0C783J9WC,2025-06-14T17:37:44.000Z,Best camera on the market - image quality is way better than the overdone HDR look of the action5,5

1,B0C783J9WC,2025-05-22T06:19:48.000Z,"Good for what it is, wish I bought a different one with a bigger screen that flips up though. It was $100-200 more expensive though so I opted for this one. Considering I got it for only like $200ish bucks, its great. Great quality pics and videos. Light and I enjoy the accessories included. The battery honestly lasts long for what I'm using it for, so I haven't needed to carry the charging case with me yet.",5
1,B0C783J9WC,2025-05-22T08:44:21.000Z,Pretty good! Used it in Hawaii and recorded everything in high quality. It overheats and notifies me but still great and I love it!,5

1,B0C783J9WC,2025-06-03T02:24:17.000Z,"This is by far one of the best action cameras I've used. Easy to use and a great platform to help with editing or updating, made using the camera easy.",5

Battery is great but best of best is the picture quality! Very eady to conndct to phone and share photos. Horizontal and vertical auto adjustmrnt for pictures also craxy.

1,B0C783J9WC,2025-07-13T06:06:35.000Z,"Bought the adventure combo. The package did not come with mounts and charging cable. All I got was a camera, frame, extension rod, batteries, battery case, mount screws and the pads. Tried returning it but it said I need to send the whole package. Decided to not send it back because it's a pain to repack everything and wait for the replacement to come. So I'm writing this review instead so people are aware.",1
1,B0C783J9WC,2025-07-15T22:12:47.000Z,"I would give more than 5 stars if I could.  The DJI Action4 is a great camera and I have used it a ton over the last couple of years.  The video quality is great as is the audio quality (for an action camera) and very reliable.  As much as I've used it has never over heated or failed in any way, it just works every time.  ",5
1,B0C783J9WC,2025-08-01T20:31:41.000Z,Not sure if my the cam I received is defective. It started get hot right after I started recording. Can't even touch the screen cause it's too hot.,1
1,B0C783J9WC,2025-07-19T19:48:41.000Z,Excelente combo para aventuras todo bien empaquetado y funcional excelentes opciones de video y nuevas tecnologías de grabaciones. Lo recomiendo,5
1,B0C783J9WC,2025-08-10T16:12:16.000Z,Im sure the camera is a good one. However when you look deep into the requirements of the download it givesa China corp access to everything on my device. I returned it. The return process was painless.,1

Just not even in direct sunlight or anything and it goes through SD card real quick which I understand it’s it’s high-quality video But my biggest complaint is they have an app for your iPhone, but not for your MacBook Pro. So beware hope you’re ready to pay Apple for iCloud storage.",3
1,B0C783YNW7,2025-04-22T03:56:04.000Z,Not bad if you get your settings right. But the battery it comes with will only last an hour on a full charge.,3

We wanted something to be able to record our kids games and this is perfect and the battery is able to record the whole game. Easy to connect to computer or tablet to view the recordings. Only has 3 zoom options for video but for our use its perfect! Great investment!,5

Therefore, I decided to keep it. But overall, the look of the box makes me feel not that good.<br /><br />The camera works great. Video recording and photographing work perfectly. Sound quality is very good. The Wi-Fi connection is stable, making downloading media through the app easy. The only downside, as far as I notice, is that it warms a little.",4

1,B0C783YNW7,2025-05-03T12:13:29.000Z,My kids used this on a trip and the video and picture quality was better than expected! Transferring to their phone from the app was super simple to free up memory card space.,5
1,B0C783YNW7,2025-05-06T00:35:22.000Z,was not able to use this product - it requires installing app with absurd license terms. without an app it's not working :(,1
1,B0C783YNW7,2025-05-05T23:08:37.000Z,Great 👍 I'm so impressed with this product,5

1,B0C783YNW7,2025-05-21T13:31:20.000Z,Was expecting better to be honest.<br />Bought this to replace my GoPro and promptly regretted it. The quick capture mode is extremely finicky only occasionally works. I’d stick with GoPro if you’re already in the GoPro family at least until Dji gets better with firmware ect. I’ll be happily using my hero ten til it dies and I’d recommend a hero 12 for even better performance than this camera.<br />The build quality seems good not as robust as GoPro and i could see it breaking down the line.<br />Theres also no wind screens for this camera and the ones that are available cover the white balance sensor so you’ll need to modify it to make it work and it doesn’t work as well when you do. Keep all this in mind if your stuck on leaving GoPro is go for the ace pro series because they’re just as good if not better!<br />Not to bash on this camera but these are points and things I wish I knew before buying the action 4. Hopefully this review clears things up if your considering copping this little camera.,3
1,B0C783YNW7,2025-05-21T18:56:56.000Z,"I wanna start off by saying this camera is probably the best thing i've bought on amazon, i got the standard combo for sale for just 209 USD and it did not dissapoint, only thing i would love to be better is battery life, but squeezing more than 2 hours in such a small battery is nearly impossible, i bring it nearly everywhere i go. Would buy again.",5
1,B0C783YNW7,2025-05-27T17:11:17.000Z,Camera works phenomenal. Just be careful when buying it. Make sure you get the insurance because battery did not last more than 60 days. That’s my only negative feedback but overall the camera is amazing with highly recommend to anyone who is on a budget and doesn’t wanna spend an arm and a leg,3

Used while snorkeling during Xmas cruise excursions, and last week diving ( OW , so &lt; 18m/60ft)<br />Already got pissed at Xmas when I had to register with a Chinese company. I waived that a couple of times, but then I couldn't use the camera without doing it. So I had to. Not happy.<br />Now, why I am writing this review:<br />The battery is already losing life. It has been on 2 trips, charged properly,... It no longer ladt the advertised 100+min in the specs .<br />And the USB cover, what you use to charge, has come off. Detached from the camera and impossible to put back. Technically,  I could still use the camera above ground, but dirt/ dust and humity could get in. And now no more diving/ snorkeling.<br />So, this was expensive for 2 trips, less than 10 outings...",1

1,B0C783YNW7,2025-07-07T11:26:08.000Z,"As someone who’s used multiple GoPros over the years, I decided to give the DJI Osmo Action 4 a shot for mountain biking and kayak fishing footage—and it far exceeded expectations.<br /><br />The 1/1.3-inch sensor delivers exceptional low-light performance, and the image clarity and color reproduction are on par with (if not better than) more expensive competitors. RockSteady 3.0+ stabilization is incredibly smooth, even on rough trails or choppy water, and the horizon leveling is a huge plus.<br /><br />Battery life is impressive, especially in extended shooting modes, and the magnetic quick-release system is extremely convenient when switching mounts. The DJI Mimo app syncs quickly, and the LightCut app streamlines editing with smart templates that actually look good.<br /><br />At $249, this is hands-down the best value in action cams right now. If DJI improves the touchscreen responsiveness just a bit, this would be a near-perfect setup. Easily a 6-star product.",5

Awesome low light shots, a ton of features and easy to use. Love the front touch screen, no need to unmount it to change anything. If you're on the fence there's a bajillion comparative reviews so don't hesitate while this is sub $200. I'm so happy to have a non budget action cam, I wasted a lot of money on the low end ones.",5

The Mic 2 is amazing and has noise suppression so strong and so good that if you're not careful it can make your live action narration sound like voiceover! So don't turn noise reduction all the way up if you like that live feel. I've dropped these. I've run one over with the scooter I was filming. I had to replace the lens cover, but that was it. I've bought two of them so far and I'll probably buy more.",5

The camera itself it’s relatively light weight so if you want to wear it on you, you can barely tell that it’s there. Connects right to your phone where you can watch the footage or you can take out the sd card and watch it on a laptop. I will say watching it on your phone makes the video not as clear whereas on a laptop it is clear and easy to see. If you’re thinking about it definitely get it.

It doesn't have an in camera option to capture still frames while capturing video.  The app doesn't make that simple either.  2.  There's no setting where getting close ups of people aren't quite distorted.. I realize that's not the main function of action cams, but would make it more useful in the places we want to bring it as our only camera.  3. Very specific to.how I wanted to use it, it's impossible to live stream using the hotspot from the same phone the app is running on.  You need one phone with the app running and a separate internet source for it to connect to wifi through.  This was really inconvenient when I was trying to stream high school volleyball games in the spring.  Besides this the app not available on Google play makes me a bit nervous and the connection to the phone is sometimes glitchy (this may we'll be my phone though.  It does have a solid build and the quality of shots is good and it's cheaper than the main competitors, so I would probably buy again, unless I knew one of the competitors didn't have the 3 issues listed above, but maybe they would have the same issues.",3

Meaning, unless you OWN or have ACCESS to one of the  mobile phone listed on it's very short list of DJI Mimo app compatible phones, the CAMERA WILL NOT WORK. The camera requires a one time activation before it can be used and the only way to do this is via the DJI Mimo app installed on one of the few phones that support it. This application is not available on PlayStore so Android users must download the APK from DJIs website and install it manually. If your phone isn't on the compatible list, you can try to install any way but it did not work for me. Thankfully, I have a friend whose phone is on the list but until we meet up to try and activate, I essentially spent over $500 on a useless, dead piece of electronics.<br />""Well, it's only needed for activation"" There are a ton of ways to activate a device/product. Like, I don't know, how about using one of the two touch screens on the camera itself to connect to wifi and activate it that way? Or, use the USB C cable to plug it into a laptop or desktop computer? No, the only way is side loading an application onto one of 30 compatible phones otherwise the device is DOA.<br />""Well, the app is needed to update the cameras firmware"" Same response above applies.<br />I shouldn't have to google, youtube and reddit search my options on how to get the device unlocked.

1,B0DBQTC2P7,2025-05-15T01:12:20.000Z,"One of the most frustrating aspects is its inability to function out of the box. You absolutely cannot use this camera until you go through the device registration process. This might seem like a minor inconvenience, but it's a significant barrier for anyone wanting to quickly capture a moment. Imagine being on location, ready for that perfect shot, only to be sidelined by a mandatory and often fiddly setup process with the DJI Mimo app.<br /><br />This forced registration also raises privacy concerns. Users are required to connect their device to DJI's servers and provide personal data, potentially including:<br /><br />Account information<br /><br />Contact information<br /><br />Location data<br /><br />Device usage information<br /><br />This level of data collection, simply to activate a camera, feels invasive and unnecessary. The issue is further compounded for Android users, who are often required to download the DJI Mimo app via a QR code provided on the camera, which leads to installing an APK file from an unknown source. This process forces users to bypass built-in Android security protections designed to prevent the installation of potentially harmful software.<br /><br />By contrast, GoPro cameras do not require registration to be used. While GoPro may collect data through app usage or optional account creation, users can start capturing footage immediately without this initial hurdle.

I can film in high resolution for extended periods without a single issue—it's incredibly stable and reliable (no overheating or random lockups).<br /><br />The image quality is truly fantastic, but the standout feature for me is the HDR video. The way it handles scenes with bright skies and deep shadows is magnificent, makes our videos really look great for YouTube.<br /><br />Pairing it directly with the DJI Mic 2 is another game-changer, providing crystal-clear audio that syncs perfectly without a fuss. If you're tired of babysitting your action camera and just want outstanding, reliable performance, the Action 5 Pro is the one to get. I'm not looking back!",5

This I think is a Apple software mod that does not show this product as a disk mounted on Desktop. I am now impressed with the great software tools and Quik app so I’m updating to 4 stars.<br /><br />First review: I’m a retired pro photorapher, used to own 5 studios and did a lot of database coding in the process. I’m running an M1 Macbook Pro , Sonoma 15.5.  This GoPro 13 couldn’t connect to my wifi after many trys, and all of a sudden, after waiting a day, it decided to connect.  I had made no alterations to my wifi.  Then after doing some shots, and connecting the usb c cable to the camera to offload images, it would not show up on the desktop.  I never have this problem with any other items. I learned that this a common issue.  So, next I decided to manually pull out the SD Card. I -refuse- to go through this gyration every time I want to offload images to my Macbook.  The placement of the SD Card slot is worse than on my old GoPro 3+. Very difficult to get to and difficult to extract the card. I run Canon R5 II, Sony A9II, Sony A6700 and many other cameras that this one ain’t worth the effort.  Will probably return it.  On the plus side, there are many useful features on this product. The Quik app worked very well for me.",4

I’m starting to make pov car videos so I need to set up the camera in a way that the cockpit and the street could be seen. I had zero issues setting up the camera for my video style. It really easy to use, touch screens are very precise, you can change the video format, the stabilization and the recording mode really easy. It’s crazy that this tiny monster has such as great camera quality and camera speaker is really loud for its size. Last but not least, I love the fact that you can attach the camera to anything with the magnetic clampse. So far 10/10 (photo is of my pov car recording setup)",5

The app is so easy to use and can make transferring data and clearing up space a one stop shop with ease. After a couple months of use, I haven’t been able to find anything I can complain about.<br />Even without a microphone it picks up my voice from inside the helmet very clearly while riding. If you are serious about capturing some high quality footage this is a great place to start.<br />Perhaps my biggest complaint is that the video quality is so high, it can quickly eat up a lot of space on your device so be sure and have a place you can store it before purchasing!

Yea, its better in low light than gopro,  but sadly it only get about 80 mbs data rate, (even after the so called ""hi bit rate"" update, they say 100,  but on average it really does around 80) where any gopro from 9 up does 130+.  Even the older Action 4 does 120.  DJI, did you think that wasn't important enough to compromise the cheaper cpu in this camera for or battery life for lower bit rate??? OMG So bad!!!!<br /><br />If you actually shoot action, where the majority of the frame is changing,  and not just talking head, then you will hate this camera and regret buying it.  The details in fast motion are totally lost, and the compression artifacts are highly visible.  Traded my gopro 10, 11, and 12's for these and now selling at a loss to try Ace 2,  or back to GoPros.<br /><br />I was so impressed with my DJI Osmo Pocket 3 gimbal cam, I sold my 5 Gopros Action cams and bought 5 Action 5 Pros.  2 projects later, very very disappointed. Compression artifacts make it look cheese... even eith the latest update. Yup they don't get hot like gopros and the battery lasts longer than gopros do because they don't move far less data per second.  So disappointing!  I was expecting an ""osmo pocket 3 without the gimbal""... Compared to a Osmo pocket 3 for picture quality, bit rate, and color, low light...,  these DJI Action 5 are just turds.  Definitely NOT ""pro""...  It's the truth.<br /><br />They get 2 stars only because i like the DJI cams have consistent design and the DJI eco system is well thought out and works well.",2

Not very happy with it for that reason.<br /><br />DJI is usually good about fixing issues but it's been over a hear and several updates but the video isn't really any better IMO.,3

1,B0DBR8HVZG,2025-06-15T00:40:08.000Z,"Extremely Disappointed – Opened Package & Clearly Used Product<br /><br />I was really looking forward to using the DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro Adventure Combo, especially after all the great reviews and hype around this model. Unfortunately, my experience has been nothing short of frustrating and disappointing.<br /><br />Right out of the box, it was obvious something wasn’t right. The packaging didn’t have the factory seal, and the internal compartments were a mess — things weren’t in their original slots, and several accessories looked like they had just been tossed back in. Some of the protective films that should cover the lens, screen, and other components were missing. Worst of all, there were clear signs that the camera had been used: smudges on the lens, minor scuffs on the body, and the battery had already been registered to a DJI account. This was supposed to be a brand new product.<br /><br />I paid full price expecting a sealed, untouched item, not a repackaged return or demo unit. For a premium device from a brand like DJI, this is completely unacceptable. Whether it’s the manufacturer or the seller who’s at fault, this level of oversight is not okay — especially for customers spending this much on what's marketed as a “pro” adventure bundle.<br /><br />I returned it immediately and now I’m hesitant to reorder, not knowing if I’ll face the same issue again. I highly recommend checking everything carefully if you decide to buy this combo, and honestly, I’d consider purchasing from a trusted retail store in person instead of online.<br /><br />DJI and their distribution partners need to step up their quality control. This kind of experience erodes trust fast.",1
1,B0DBR8HVZG,2025-06-15T13:59:18.000Z,"ting like go pro.<br />If you were in doubt about it? I can affirm for sure DJI pro 5 has everything you need in one camera.<br />Waterproof ocean water and natural water. But after using at the ocean or swimming pool always wash your camera and make sure you closed all the connection’s ports so you won’t have any issues.<br />DJI pro 5 has the functionalities of time lapse, slow motion, tracking, UHD 4k, the app works perfectly and gives you many options of resume of your videos and other options. I’m using on my iPhone 13 Pro Max and works perfectly and I use on my Samsung S20FE and worked perfectly too.<br />Another thing that I loved is when you are recording you can see you on the front screen too. And if you are using just to record around and using only the back screen, so you can turn off the front screen, the same with the back screen. Something I got disappointed with the Insta360 ace pro 2, because I need all the time to move the back screen when I wanna see if I’m recording myself on the right way.<br />This camera with the combo worthy what you are paying for.",5
1,B0DBR8HVZG,2025-06-15T13:59:18.000Z,"A such great camera! I have been using since February so now I came here to give my opinion.<br />This camera is not just an action camera, it’s more than that. The combo comes with everything of you need, with one battery I could record for the whole day, but of course it depends of the Quality of video you are using, weather if very hot of course your battery is going to drain faster like your phone.<br />I was in Brazil is very hot, I use going to the beach, swimming pool, parks, at the rain, day light, night light, low light. This camera has a great response with the lights.<br />The brilliant idea of the DJI is giving to this camera an internal memory, so you can start recording right away. But if like to record everything in the maximum resolution you will need a great memory card, because if it has a low quality, it can slow down your camera and you won’t be able to record in total high quality anyway.<br />It’s good it can get a polarized lens set, so if you are in a place like a beach, snow, you can adjust the reflections.<br />The other good thing on DJI pro 5 is the track. The camera will track you don’t matter the movement you are doing.<br />The camera’s microphone is wonderful, you can record everything. If you are inside of some place like your office, bedroom, the camera will capture your voice perfectly. But if you are outside and you need more attention to your voice I recommend to get the microphone DJI mic 2 because the comes with the receiver inside already, and for sure the receiver connection is way better than a Bluetooth connection.<br />With the receiver connection you can be in a such huge distance and the microphone will still capture your voice. Totally different of a Bluetooth connection it gets maximum 10m if you don’t have any interference.<br />So what I can say go pro is nothing close of DJI 5 pro you can you as a personal camera for a blog, webcam, Studio camera and of course a amazing action camera, without worrying about over hea",5

1,B0DBR8HVZG,2025-06-23T05:33:35.000Z,"Overall, it's an absolutely spectacular camera!<br /><br />The only issue (which is actually quite big) is that you are required to finish setup of the camera through their app, which on it's own would be fine, but it was removed from the playstore not that long ago. <br />That means you are required to download their app off their website where only a select few phones (as of writing this review) are able to download their app (A decent range of IPhones for IOS, but for Android, only 7 higher-end Samsungs mixed in with a ton of Chinese Phones).<br /><br />Just be sure to look for ""DJI Mimo"" to see if your phone is actually compatible with downloading the app. Also be careful; the reason I've heard that the app is off the playstore is due to security reasons.<br /><br />The fact this wasn't communicated well before I bought my A5 Pro is why I am giving a negative review.",2

I know it's waterproof, so everything was fine, until I fell into the river in a very deep area and accidentally lost the camera.<br /><br />I struggled for almost an hour, and it was impossible because it was too deep.<br /><br />So the next day I called the waterfall park to let them know I'd lost my camera the day before.<br />They called me 24 hours after I lost it, and when I pressed the power button, it turned on automatically.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting that; I was hoping to recover the photos from the memory card, but it just worked as if nothing had happened.<br /><br />That happened two weeks ago, and the camera is still working fine.<br /><br />Just perfect.",5

The Essentials combo pack assumes you already have some action camera mounts, and only includes the camera.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about the setup process on Android is that you MUST download and install (sideload) the DJI Mimo application to register it to activate and update the firmware. Once it has been updated and registered, you do not need to continue using the app if you don't want to.<br /><br />I turned the screen on and it recorded 1080p continuously for 3 hours and 45 minutes, so I believe their 4+ hour battery life (if you let the screen auto turn off).<br /><br />When you plug it into a computer, you can transfer files as if it is a hard drive, or use it as a PC webcam, or just charge the battery via the USB-C port. It has 64GB of native storage, which you can add to with a user supplied microSD card.<br /><br />It is designed to be natively waterproof down to 20 meters  as long as the ports are latched closed.  I've only tested it under a few feet of water, but it worked great sticking it under my dock.<br /><br />The subject tracking and stabilization work great. Shooting an HD vertical video while holding the camera horizontally gave a large amount of left/right play for the subject tacking to really work in. If you shoot a horizontal video while holding the camera horizontally it tracks/stabilizes within a smaller window but doesn't have as much space around the ""edges"" to work with.<br /><br />The touch screen interface on the rear is relatively easy to use (you have to play around a bit to figure out which of the 4 ""swipe directions"" goes to what configuration menu, but after you figure things out it's not difficult to navigate through the various menus to select different modes. I especially appreciate the timelapse mode for documenting the ""big pict",4

1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-04-08T21:18:35.000Z,"I could go either with this one or the Action 4 based on how they are priced relative to each other. If money is no object, or they are both priced without sales, this one is the way to go. Already I've benefitted from the built in storage. Such a nice touch. I forgot the card already once. The new OLED display is beautiful. These are just solid, versatile cameras. I do wish the hyperfocal distance it's set at allowed for a more close focus, but I understand the camera can be modified to do it.<br /><br />They do get warm, but that is because of the waterproof housing. The body does a great job of moving heat out into the air. The additional battery life in this model over the previous is a great reason to step up as well. However, I've been using it with the app on my phone as an external monitor. That little wifi connection really consumes a lot more battery power quickly.<br /><br />Overall, nice camera for sure.",4

When it came time for a new cam it was a no brainer. Action 5 runs with the best on other features and picture quality, but none of them can wireless sound as well as DJI. My GP 13 has Bluetooth sound but sounds like a tin can and always has to be relinked. I love that the mounting bracket can be mounted on the side, but the bracket itself needs to fold and have a mounting screw to be perfect. The internal memory storage has already been a lifesaver when I forgot to reload card before heading out. Cant wait to add a 360 cam to the ecosystem when it comes out.",5

I was shocked as the quality of the picture because, often, the action camera pictures are just okay. Another thing I liked about this set was the case. The case felt durable and sturdy. It wasn't like to usual plastic cases. The accessory piece that holds the screw (unsure what it's called) is magnetic. The magnetic accessory is easy to place on the case and it stays on. The camera does not come with an SD card. Other than that, I'm incredibly pleased with the quality of this camera.",5

I debated a long time and did lots of research on thia vs gopro hero 13 but what finally convinced me was an actual first person side by side comparison.  The action 5 peforms way better in low light situations.  I bought this canera primarily to scuba dive and shooting side by side videos with gopro theres no question the dji is better.  Its the sensor size which is a little bigger than the gopros.  The main down side is you need to download an app to activate the camera. Using a diving housing also prevents the use of the touchscreen so you cant switch between video and pic mode.  Other than those 2 things the video quality is excellent.  Would recommed highly,5

SECOND is the lens flare, yes all lenses have a certain amount of flare in the sun buy this is the worst I have seen from a camera, it always looks like a ""trumpet"" in the sky, this is from a cheap poorly configured lens.  THIRD is the uneven color in the sky, there is always a darker blue in the center of the sky for about a third of the photos.

This caused much frustration until I remembered that I have an android tablet and tried to download it via the tablet. This proved successful and I was able to finally activate the camera. I'm giving it 3 stars at this stage because the activation process was too problematic. If you're making a world class product, then you need to make activation more customer friendly. I haven't really started using the camera as yet; I plan to use it to record my runs.

1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-06-28T17:06:45.000Z,"As someone who loves capturing adventures—especially at night and outdoor excursions—the Osmo Action 5 Pro has seriously impressed me. Right off the bat, the new 1/1.3"" sensor delivers incredible low-light performance. I took it biking at dusk through some wooded trails, and the clarity and detail were far beyond what I expected. I was able to portray different light settings.<br />The enhanced subject tracking is great aspect! Thanks to its powerful 4nm chip, the framing adjusts quickly, even when I'm moving fast or switching angles. Whether I’m filming in landscape or portrait (16:9 or 9:16), it keeps me or my subject perfectly centered with little effort on my part.<br />Activating the camera via the DJI Mimo app was pretty straightforward -although it’s worth noting that the app isn’t on Google Play anymore. I just scanned the QR code right on the camera screen and downloaded it that way—quick fix, but good to know ahead of time.<br />One of the most practical upgrades is the battery life. I’ve easily pushed close to 4 hours of use on a single charge. This is great for when you out for extended periods of time.<br />The dual OLED touchscreens are another favorite feature—bright, colorful, and super responsive. I can easily frame shots, review footage, and adjust settings without second-guessing what I’m seeing, even in full sunlight.<br />Of course, stability matters most with action cams, and the 360° HorizonSteady tech does not disappoint. Whether I’m riding, hiking, or just filming handheld, the footage stays incredibly smooth. It’s almost surreal how steady it looks.<br />Lastly, the audio quality is surprisingly crisp. I paired it with the DJI Mic Mini, and the results were fantastic—great clarity and no need for a bulky receiver setup. This alone makes it a go-to for moto vlogging or talking clips on the go. Overall this has been great for vlogging and easy to use!",5

I have an Amazfit watch, and I need to figure out a way to incorporate some of the data from this watch as well. This is week one, so I'll have more knowledge about this camera. ",4
1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-07-17T14:09:56.000Z,The camera is very easy to use and the menu is easy to navigate. I didn't have to look through the instructions to understand how to use it. It really takes beautiful videos. It's very small and great size to travel with,5

1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-07-22T04:03:50.000Z,"Excellent action camera, without a doubt, I love this camera. I need a camera to record while I work and this one is great.",5
1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-07-26T20:29:08.000Z,This camera is the best I have had in a long time. I think I should have bought the bundle vs each item separately.,5
1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-08-02T20:07:06.000Z,"This is a fantastic and amazing camera! It has a lot of different options in terms of filming, 1080 to 2k, all the way to 4k - all with two types of ratio, 16:9 or 3:4 I believe. Different options will yield different maximum duration of recording (and data size), but great that it comes with internal memory as well, something you barely see cameras do, if ever. I’ve tested out the image stabilization as well, and it’s quite smooth, a great factor if anyone wants to start vlogging which is a huge bonus. It’s different modes of usage, from regular photos, recording, hyperlapse, to timelapse.<br /><br />It’s small, compact, and it charges quick. You can see in the picture compared to a US quarter! This ting is tiny but packs a punch! And the battery is great so far because when you film, there’s also a display saving mode where the screen goes dim and only shows you the duration of capture so far. I do want to record long road trips down the line, so I may pick up some spare batteries eventually. The build quality is nice, sturdy, and waterproof, which is also something I want to take on my adventures when we travel abroad. This doesn’t come with a flip screen like the Ace Pro 2, but I prefer it this way because it’s another hardware that I have to be mindful of, constantly abusing the hinges. DJI decided to have a front facing display to remedy this and it’s great! You’re able to control and preview anything from either sides.<br /><br />If I HAD to nitpick - the downside of this one is the audio, which by all means isn’t bad and absolutely normal with all cameras. I’ve done my research and the Insta360 Ace Pro 2 has a shield for the audio to reduce noise which is a great perk. But comparing the two, for quality of recording and night time options, I went with the Action 5 Pro. I bought a shotgun mic (Movo X1 Minit) to attach to the camera so I can reduce the surrounding noise and get more audio coming in to the direction I’m facing.<br /><br />Overall extremely happ",5
1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-08-02T20:07:06.000Z,y with the purchase. Can’t wait to use it on different occasions!,5
1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-08-04T22:57:58.000Z,"No compren este artículo. Jamás me llegó, perdí el dinero, nadie se hace responsable, Amazon no me brinda pruebas de que fue entregado el artículo y como al parecer a los de otros países nos categorizan como a ellos les place no se hacen responsables, ahí adjunto pruebas, No GASTEN su dinero lo van a perder",1
1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-08-12T09:58:37.000Z,"Terrible packaging! No protective wrapping at all! The box arrived completely smashed, with a broken frame inside and chips on the protective glass! shame on you DJI",1
1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-08-14T14:09:17.000Z,I ordered and paid for a DJI OSMO ACTION 5 PRO and the seller sent me an open box with a DJI Action 4 inside the DJI Action 5 Pro box. This is unacceptable!! I don’t recommend this seller.<br /><br />At Jose A Perez Rivera,1
1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-08-14T06:13:16.000Z,"Recieved email stating the package delayed. Then, Recieved an email stating package arrived. The package arrived damaged and only the accessary pack was in it. The camera was missing. Cant rate this since it never got here",1
1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-08-15T04:16:23.000Z,"Estoy contento con mi compra, es mi segunda cámara de acción y esta de aqui esta muy bien hecha.<br />Escogí esta cámara frente a Go Pro Hero 13 y no me arrepiento.",5
1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-08-16T14:23:21.000Z,No action cam comes close to this one. I will stick with this company from now on! Thanks again I will be purchasing more.,5
1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-08-16T23:53:38.000Z,"[[VIDEOID:52066bc6048503f25af92222768f87a7]] I recently picked up the DJI Action Camera and it’s impressive! The image quality is fantastic, touchscreens are responsive making it easy to switch between modes and settings. Connects to phone easily for video control, transfer and the DJI app is easy to use.",5
1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-08-17T01:26:15.000Z,"This camera is awesome, the price is a little steep, but worth it. I love the usable touch screen on both sides of the camera, it makes “selfie” mode super easy. The battery life and onboard storage is more than enough for me and that was my main reason for buying this camera over a GoPro. It’s a really clever design and plays nicely with all my old GoPro mounts and accessories. This thing is awesome and I plan on using it as a POV camera to film roadside emergency calls.",5
1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-08-17T22:09:44.000Z,"Si sos de Argentina y no queres pagar un excedente por el producto en nuestro país, te recomiendo que lo compres sin dudar. Es una camara versatil, cómoda y de buena resolución en cada foto o video que graba. Que tenga memoria integrada es un golazo. Viene con una funda protectora para golpes, pero te recomiendo le compres los films protectores de pantalla. La bateria, en maxima resolución, dura 3 horas continuas de video. Tiene carga rápida. Sin dudas, la mejor compra!",5
1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-08-18T16:21:48.000Z,"The DJI Action 5 Pro is an outstanding compact camera for everyday use. It powers on quickly, feels incredibly durable, and has completely replaced my other action cams. Switching between vertical and horizontal shooting is effortless, and the app connection makes it simple to monitor or frame shots directly from your phone.<br /><br />Video quality is excellent, even in low light, and its compact size makes it easy to carry in a pocket or backpack. There are also plenty of aftermarket accessories, from filters to mounts, that expand its versatility.<br /><br />One feature I really appreciate is the ability to use two DJI Mics at the same time — unlike the Action 4 Pro, which only supports a single mic. This is a huge plus for creators who need dual audio setups.<br /><br />One note: the battery case included with the Adventure Combo doesn’t charge the batteries. However, it’s still useful for safely storing them and can also function as a power bank.<br /><br />Overall, the Action 5 Pro is a powerful, travel-friendly camera that’s perfect for vlogging, action shots, and everyday recording.",5
1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-08-18T18:50:48.000Z,Exelente,5
1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-08-18T23:16:41.000Z,Excellent camera especially for underwater and action shots. Easy to use especially if you’ve used a GoPro before. Would definitely suggest purchasing one if one is interested.,5
1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-08-18T23:33:16.000Z,So far I like it. But the battery life is not the best. I think the quality is good,5

1,B0DS2DF5S5,2025-08-22T15:18:43.000Z,"Included camera mount does not work. Spent 30 minutes on the phone with them trying to find the serial number, they don't know their own products. After finding the serial number they want ME to pay to send the whole camera back so they can check it. Have a osmo 4 and 2, the mount does not work on them but their mounts work on the 5. It's a $12 part and they want to fight about and are losing a customer over the poor service. Recomened avoiding them as well",1
