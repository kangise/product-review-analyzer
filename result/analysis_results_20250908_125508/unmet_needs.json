        "I purchased the Insta360 X4 on March 26, 2025, and received it on March 31. I was excited to use this camera, especially after watching numerous positive reviews and reading about its durability and performance in demanding conditions. From day one, I noticed it gets unusually hot during recording, but I initially brushed it off, thinking it was just part of its high-performance nature. Everything worked fairly well until May 1, when I brought it to a major police sports event, a high-profile assignment where I was expected to capture key footage. I recorded in 8K 30fps during midday under a sunny sky. To my shock and embarrassment, the camera overheated and shut down just 3 minutes into recording.",
        "Does get too hot and turns off for excessive heat it not fair to pay so much money for that cámara It's great to be able to shoot 360 but can't not stay too long on without getting hot",
        "Este nuevo modelo tiene muchísimos problemas para hacer lo que promete por sobre calentamiento... Puedes perder momentos importantes porque se apaga automáticamente",
        "Camera is very laggy and gets very hot very quickly when recording really bummed with how expensive this product cost for it to perform so poorly",
        "I don't know if is just me , but it come defective, overheat and lost charge quickly"

If you want to feel like smashing your computer multiple times throughout the editing process, this is the device for you. The insta360 studio is the clunkiest piece of garbage I've ever used to edit video.",
        "The camera itself is a marvel but the software used to edit and export video stops working for many people. For me, the studio software works fine on my laptop but won't export from my desktop.",
        "The insta 360 itself is awful overall. Sure, the camera videos are impressive but it's actually impossible to get your videos edited. The app is terrible because it crashes and won't ever load a video to 100%.",
        "The camera is fine, however the mandatory software is absolutely horrible. The 'AI' BS sucks, the autoframing is whatever, most of the time even with keyframes I'm lookin at the exact opposite of what I want in the final videos.",
