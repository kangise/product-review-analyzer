        "Normal cameras only record what you're pointing at, something happens next to you and you're not pointing to it, you've missed the moment and it's not coming back. This camera ensures that never happens again.",
        "I love that the X4 is a tiny, little, lightweight camera! Shooting in 8k30fps 360 mode gives me some peace of mind knowing that as long as I'm recording/vlogging I'm always going to get the shot because I'll be able to reframe it later.",
        "The ability to shoot first and frame later is everything. I don't have to worry about missing anything, and I can pull clips in any aspect ratio — wide for YouTube, vertical for Reels, square for thumbnails.",
        "This is literally a camera you can walk around with and not have to worry about keeping anyone in the frame or making sure you got the shot. As long as the action is happening around the camera or within view of it, you can see it after the fact.",
        "You don't need experience to edit your recordings, Insta360 has several videos on how to edit your videos like a pro, and they're easy to follow."
