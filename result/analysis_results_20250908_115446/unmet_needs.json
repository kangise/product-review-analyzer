        "Camera stopped working 1 day into vacation in Mexico. Camera only went 12\" under water with all access ports fully closed! Very frustrating when buy a \"waterproof\" camera for vacation",

        "I purchased the Insta360 X4 on March 26, 2025, and received it on March 31. Everything worked fairly well until May 1, when I brought it to a major police sports event, a high-profile assignment where I was expected to capture key footage. I recorded in 8K 30fps during midday under a sunny sky. To my shock and embarrassment, the camera overheated and shut down just 3 minutes into recording.",
        "Does get too hot and turns off for excessive heat it not fair to pay so much money for that cámara",
        "Este nuevo modelo tiene muchísimos problemas para hacer lo que promete por sobre calentamiento... Puedes perder momentos importantes porque se apaga automáticamente",
        "This camera does so much and the quality is crazy good!! Better than I could imagine. Gets hot during charging and active use.",
        "I should note that after my return is completed since I didn't see a similar comment/review. This was my first live action 360 camera, and I enjoyed this camera a lot while I noticed the body of camera is heated when it is on. It was probably over 105 F (40C) since I felt really hot."

        "Great camera, awful apps. I bought the camera and took it on a trip… The battery life is a joke—nowhere near the advertised 130 minutes.",
        "Battery life is very short, to pull videos off the card that is provided. It's extremely difficult",
        "The quality is amazing, the only con for me is that it dies in like an hour, but other than that, I love it",
        "Other than an incredibly short battery life, which makes me run it in nothing higher than 4K at 30 FPS, I think it's a great unit.",
