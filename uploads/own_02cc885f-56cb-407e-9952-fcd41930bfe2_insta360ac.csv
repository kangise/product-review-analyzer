My Insta360 X3 ceased working after 2 years, and was sent to Insta360 for repair. Insta360 repair lost my X3, then wanted to bill me $73.50 for a hypothetical ""motherboard"" issue (a 50% discount on the $146.99 cost of repairing a ""motherboard"") in exchange for a new X3, DESPITE NEVER HAVING EXAMINED MY X3 THAT INSTA360 LOST.

A 360 camera is like having a multicamera film crew in your pocket...or like having one of those cranes that carries a film camera, which can be pointed in any direction, but this camera points in ALL directions at once.<br /><br />If you had unlimited cash and reckless abandon, you could hit the record button on this camera, chuck it across a field, and have a perfectly stable shot focused on whatever you want, if your SD card survives the aftermath..lol. The image stabilization works the same way YouTube videos can be optionally stabilized after you upload footage to the site...the software zooms in on your subject, creating a cropped image, and eliminates all jiggling that way. However, since this camera films everything around it at once, there is unlimited area for the software to zoom, resulting it completely stable footage in any direction, on any subject captured by the 2 lenses.<br /><br />Since each lens actually captures WIDER than 180 degrees (the area captured by each lens overlaps), the software is able to remove the selfie stick at the bottom, if you choose to frame the your shot focusing on yourself. This allows you to create footage that looks as if it is being shot from a drone following you (if you're clever and hold the stick in the right way).<br /><br />To frame your footage on what you want your video to be focused, you can use either the PC/mac software, or the phone app. Since your phone has accelerometers, you can play your footage back on the app while orienting your phone as you would your head when you look around at things, and focus on whatever you want after the fact.

Less than a year in, the selfie stick failed—snapping at the thickest part (second segment)—causing me to lose the entire camera while riding at low highway speeds on my cruiser.<br /><br />I contacted Insta360 customer service hoping for a resolution. Unfortunately, they refused to replace the camera, citing speed limitations of 80 km/h (49 mph) for the selfie stick—a detail never clearly stated in the product description or marketing materials. For a bundle marketed specifically for motorcycles, this kind of limitation is misleading and unacceptable.<br /><br />The X4 is a very expensive camera, and for the company to provide such a fragile mounting solution without proper warning is, in my opinion, dishonest.<br /><br />For comparison, I’ve used a GoPro Hero8 for years, and when a mount failed, GoPro replaced it without question. That kind of support builds trust and brand loyalty.<br /><br />If you’re looking for a reliable setup for rear or front motorcycle footage, I strongly recommend researching other brands—especially if you ride at normal highway speeds.

1,1 - US,1,421,gl_camera,B0DWN8V6J8,B0DD443GHF,78105865861,Solid 360 Action Cam If You Temper Expectations on Video Quality,"I bought this camera specifically for recording my mountain bike outings, and overall it’s not bad—as long as you frame your expectations within what an action cam can realistically do. If you’re used to shooting with a decent regular camera or even a recent flagship smartphone, the drop in image quality is going to be noticeable. And when you get into 360 cameras, you have to temper those expectations even more.<br /><br />By nature, a 360 cam is spreading its pixels over a much larger field of view, and then the stitching process seems to introduce extra noise and grain that you don’t really see with regular action cams like the DJI Osmo series. At first I honestly thought mine might have been faulty, but after comparing it with videos on YouTube from others using the same camera in similar mountain biking scenarios, I realized this is just the current state of 360 cams in general.<br /><br />Looking at footage from the newer X5 model with the larger sensor, it does look like Insta360 is improving things, but it’s still not on par with the crispness you’d expect if you’re comparing it to a modern phone camera. For a quick reality check: if you’ve got a flagship phone from the last five years (Samsung S20, iPhone 14, etc.), it will easily produce cleaner, sharper video than any 360 camera currently available.<br /><br />What you are really paying for here is the durability, compact design, and of course the 360-degree field of view. On those counts, it delivers. The ability to reframe shots after the fact and capture the entire ride without worrying about where the camera is pointing is genuinely fun and useful.<br /><br />The Insta360 Studio software has also been better than I expected.

1,1 - US,1,421,gl_camera,B0F442RLDH,B0DSBT58MK,75460554151,"Versatile camera, challenging to edit content","This is a very unique and interesting camera that allows you to capture 360 degree video and use any part of the video you choose. The camera itself is well built and high quality, and has both a front & back lens. It's actually a bit heavy. There are many options such as video, photo, timelapse, HDR, Timeshift, Bullet time, loop recording, dash cam, burst & interval shooting. There are so many options it takes a while to practice and understand how each option works. The bundle came with an additional battery, charger, extra lens covers, a screen protector, case and a tote bag. There is no SD card included and you have to purchase the selfie stick separately. The camera can be used on any mount with a 1/4 screw so you can get some great perspectives. It does run hot when filming in 8k and there is a thermal protector included in the main camera box. The videos it captures are really cool as you can see 360 degrees around you. However, the video editing can be a bit challenging and I consider myself a relatively experienced video editor. You can upload footage to your computer and use the editing software, or connect to the app and edit there. You can also import footage into Premiere Pro. Due to being 360 degrees, you can see wobbly areas in the footage where it is stitched together. It takes practice to get the end result you want if you want to slice & dice the footage you capture.

One battery, a small case that doesn’t hold much more than the camera and cable, Standard lens protectors, and the thermal guard. Action Bundle addition includes another battery and fast charger that holds up to 3 batteries, a screen protector, Premium Lens Guards, and a harder case that not only holds the camera, but also holds the fast charger, two batteries, and the standard size invisible selfie stick. Do note that there’s no selfie stick or micro SD card in this kit, so you’ll need to purchase those separately. You might also consider buying a rubber lens protector to insulate them when you put the camera down or pack it away.<br /><br />Given the damage potential of the two fish eye lenses, it’s great to have the premium lens guards, which are aluminum and glass, whereas the standard lens guards are plastic. With this model, normally, a damaged lens would mean sending it off for repair and replacement. The standard and premium lens guards each have their own settings since you’re adding another layer at a distance from the lens, so make sure you change the appropriate setting. Keep in mind that adding a lens means you have to make sure both layers are clean, and each can cause some odd light refraction in certain circumstances. The ideal would be to avoid the lens guards, but depending on your use, I’d prioritize avoiding lens damage. For example, indoor static use on a secure monopod might be OK to use the bare lenses, but in an environment where the camera may topple, using the premium lens guards is wise. <br /><br />The thermal guard is purely for hand protection rather than heat dissipation. If you’re shooting video in 8K, the camera gets very hot very qui",5,,"also holds the fast charger, two batteries, and the standard size invisible selfie stick",0.75,b1258e96-d023-404b-950d-9d8458145c13,product component related specs or functionalities,battery and power,charging,fast charging,positive,2025-05-12T01:30:41.000Z,2025-08-24T01:47:47.000Z,2025/5/10 00:00

The thermal guard makes it easier to handle. <br /><br />8K video also uses the battery a bit faster, so it’s a major plus that this kit includes a second battery and a fast charger.  The importance of shooting 9K is that, unlike earlier versions of this camera, you have a lot more resolution to zoom in if you’re using the video in a 4K timeline. The file sizes are large, and I’d always recommend using the high bit rate setting for quality. 5.7 K+ will yield a smaller file size, but I’d prefer to have the greater zoom potential. 5.7K (not plus) allows for higher frame rates if slow motion is important. At a normal 30fps, it handles lower light a bit better. All this gives you significant situational flexibility depending on your shooting situation.<br /><br />Photo mode shoots at either 72MP or 18MP when shooting 360, and half each if you’re just using single camera mode. For best dynamic range and internal processing, using PureShot is nice, although there’s also a photo HDR mode. Given the common uses, such as 360 real estate virtual tours, there’s a timer mode that allows you to get out of the picture before the photo is taken.  In both video and photo mode, there’s an array of auto and manual settings that give you many of the typical controls you’d expect. <br /><br />Additionally, there’s a bunch of interesting modes such as timelapse, timeshift, bullet time (be sure to get the bullettime accessories to make best use of that), loop recording, starlapse (night time time lapse), and burst mode.<br /><br />The kit comes with a plethora of manuals accounting for the camera and the use of each of the accessories, and they point to the website for much deeper tutorials complete with video guides as well.

1,1 - US,1,421,gl_camera,B0F442RLDH,B0DSBT58MK,76202875401,Very High Quality Product - Well-made & Well-designed - Creates Incredibly Versatile Video,"ned, rugged, versatile camera, this might be the one for you.  I've had a GoPro for several years, using it to film everything from stuff around the house to outdoor and underwater action scenes, and have been very impressed with the quality and the design features.  This insta360 X4 is of similar or better quality than the GoPro I've had for years, and gives me not only the ability to make fantastic, creative, outdoor and scenery videos, but is also amazing to use for ""regular"" videos owing to the amazing versatility of being able to choose from a 360 degree panorama of 8K video.  (Imagine a video of your child opening a birthday present and being able to have, for say, a close-up of the present, but also your child's facial reaction, and any other element you might choose to grab from around the room, such as yourself, or others in attendance, or maybe just the room itself - everything is seen by the camera, and you get to choose what you want to see when you edit the video.)<br />  THE ACTION BUNDLE:<br />  THE EXTRA BATTERY & 3-PORT FAST CHARGE HUB: If you're doing lots of filming, having the extra battery and a hub for charging is really helpful, avoiding down-time waiting for a battery to charge.

I would say that the stick is a must for incredible shots, some will look like they are acquired with a drone.  The underwater diving case is not included either and is a must if you are diving at more than 33ft/10m.<br />One must install the Insta360 App to the phone and connect it for setting up and control of the camera.<br />The App is a pretty steep learning curve, so many settings....p.e. there is a setting if you are using lens guards, diving cases, etc. Post-processing will also seen somewhat difficult if one has never had experience with video editing software.  There are paid subscription services that popup when not expected, such as cloud service, pro editing, etc.<br />I have posted some images during a beach day, notice the last image with the stitching error.<br /><br />Previously and for many years, I got accustomed with the simpler, all terrain GoPro cameras. They are smaller and much easier to use, without the complexity of 360 imaging.  I will reserve this camera for special occasions that require full field imaging.<br /><br />At the time of ordering this Insta360 X4 Action Bundle, the newest Insta360 X5 was launched.

The underwater diving case is not included either and is a must if you are diving at more than 33ft/10m.<br />One must install the Insta360 App to the phone and connect it for setting up and control of the camera.<br />The App is a pretty steep learning curve, so many settings....p.e. there is a setting if you are using lens guards, diving cases, etc. Post-processing will also seen somewhat difficult if one has never had experience with video editing software.  There are paid subscription services that popup when not expected, such as cloud service, pro editing, etc.<br />I have posted some images during a beach day, notice the last image with the stitching error.<br /><br />Previously and for many years, I got accustomed with the simpler, all terrain GoPro cameras. They are smaller and much easier to use, without the complexity of 360 imaging.  I will reserve this camera for special occasions that require full field imaging.<br /><br />At the time of ordering this Insta360 X4 Action Bundle, the newest Insta360 X5 was launched. The latest X5 version has better overheating protection and has replaceable lenses that version X4 did not have. Furthermore, the X5 Action Bundle can be bought at my electronic store for at least $150 less than this bundle.",4,,I would say that the stick is a must for incredible shots,0.22,22cce733-1874-44f0-b997-ecea10a2e41b,product component related specs or functionalities,quality,camera quality,good picture,positive,2025-05-28T05:27:48.000Z,2025-08-11T05:12:06.000Z,2025/5/24 00:00

And in fact shortly after purchasing the X4 I realized that the X5 version had already been released. Since this review is already dated I will limit it to more general topics and only those specific issues that I have been able to pick up in a couple months of sporadic operation as a new user.<br /><br />The first section on Resolution may be skipped although it may give some insight into the limitations of what you can get out of an 8K 360 degree camera.  I would give this camera 5 stars for its wide-field video quality, but it doesn't have sufficient resolution to stand up to a great deal of zooming and cropping in post processing editing, hence the overall 4 star rating.<br /><br />Resolution considerations<br /><br />8k resolution in a camera sounds impressive at a time when the most readily available TV and prosumer video camera resolution is usually 4k. But reality sets in when you take a more in-depth look, particularly how it applies to a camera tasked with recording the entire spherical world around it rather than just a segment of that, which would be the case with an ordinary camera with a more limited field of view.<br /><br />The common resolution numbers that you hear proclaimed in display or camera specifications (2K, 4K, or 8K) refers to the approximate horizontal pixel count (2000, 4000, or 8000) of the display or the imaging sensor.  These are really just rounded-up approximations (because why would any manufacturer ever round down?) of the actual pixel count.  Depending on the aspect ratio of the display or imaging sensor there will be a vertical pixel count associated with that horizontal resolution. Numbers like 720p, 1080i or 1080p refer to the vertical resolution.  2K resolution has 1920 horizontal pixels, and and 4K has 3840 horizontal pixels, but the vertical pixel count can vary with the aspect ratio (wi",4,,where it appears the the X5 lens replacement is quite simple,0.41,f784ec9f-f192-4c75-a7a9-cb87cd12f206,product component related specs or functionalities,camera related,lenses,good lens replacement,positive,2025-07-24T07:13:39.000Z,2025-08-13T09:27:53.000Z,2025/7/19 00:00

As mentioned earlier, if recording in 360 mode and if you know you are going to be cropping the field of view in post processing it is a good idea to point one of your lenses in that general direction as you record.

While the X4 non-replaceable lenses really are replaceable when you get down to it, it is more of a tech-level repair that involves getting inside the camera's guts, something akin to replacing a phone battery on a ""not user serviceable"" device.  You will be slicing glue joints and it's not for everyone, where it appears the the X5 lens replacement is quite simple.<br /><br />Compared to my older Hero 8 GoPro I find the user interface on the X4 to be much easier to use.  Frankly I dislike almost everything about the GoPro, from the tiny screen with oversize icons to the huge quantity of dead sensor pixels that makes night sky timelapses look like absolute crap (unless you like stars to twinkle when they encounter dead pixels). There are still too many cryptic icon symbols to learn in the Insta360 menus, but there isn't much space for anything else.<br /><br />The X4 screen seems huge by comparison to the GoPro, and even though the interface design is somewhat similar with the pull-out markers on all sides it just seems more friendly to use with a much smaller percentage of the screen hogged up by icons.<br /><br />All of the buttons on the X4 are very firm and you are unlikely to accidentally press anything (except of course the touchscreen) in normal handling.  I think that, like with the GoPro, operating the menus with gloves would be difficult.<br /><br />One thing I still have trouble accepting is the fact that I can't seem to toggle Direction Lock at the camera itself.  It seemed strange at first in 360 mode to aim one of the lenses at the area of interest only to find that on playback (within the camera) the view would be fixed unless changed by scrolling on the camera's touchscreen.

In some ways this is a minor upgrade; the maximum resolution hasn't changed for example. But there are some game changers that make it a worthwhile purchase.<br /><br />I have focused on two:<br /><br />(1) The ability to replace lenses yourself is very welcome and a significant enough development in itself to warrant an upgrade. I have always babied my 360 cameras from GoPro Max, to X3 and X4 being constantly terrified of ruining the lens and therefore the camera. When cycling with the camera low to the ground I have used lens guards which always, always add distortion and increase flare significantly, compromising the usability of the footage you make. Now with X5 I I do not believe I will need to use lens guards at all, I have a replacement lens kit on order and will always keep one in my bag with the X5 when using it.<br /><br />(2) The other game changer is the audio quality. I did not care for audio on 360 cameras until X4 came along as the first 360 camera with good enough image quality to be used as a regular action camera, or even as a vlogging camera. With X4 I started using it for those purposes but the audio was, well it was 'OK'. What Insta360 have done with the audio on X5 is amazing, the microphone capsule hidden under the mesh on the camera deliver an incredible balanced and clear sound quality. Just set it to Auto wind noise reduction (your choice for weak or strong) and leave it there.<br /><br />Others have said they are having issues with the app upgrade and being able to register the X5. I am US based and a regular user of Insta360 cameras, my iPhone iOS app updated no problem and the X5 is now registered.<br /><br />IMO this is a very worthwhile upgrade eve if you just consider the replaceable lenses and audio quality.",5,,compromising the usability of the footage you make,0.51,1e661dd4-0207-474d-859e-dc7a79a08a0d,product component related specs or functionalities,image,image or picture clarity,bad quality footage,negative,2025-04-26T02:20:24.000Z,2025-08-24T05:27:04.000Z,2025/4/26 00:00

Even the built-in audio mics are up to the task, with a bit of help from the Izotope Ozone Elements audio mixing plugin for DaVinci Resolve Fairlight (I use the Warm Synth preset). It's absolutely wonderful to be able to place the tiny camera 1-2 inches from the keyboard, and it will capture the pianist as the main eye-strong subject with the flute and cello nicely framed as secondary subjects. The recordings are simply stunning - I film in ProRes 4K/30 at High bitrate, then edit in Resolve (not much editing needed). Even though the file size is huge (25GB for 5 min of music), the workflow is VERY smooth with my i5 PC and RTX 3080 graphics card. I look forward eagerly to doing more music recordings, as they yield beautiful video and audio. (The ProRes 422 footage is amazing before export - every little bit of quality helps.) I export in H.264, as there is a bit of quality loss with H.265. The resulting file for YouTube is around 2 GB, which is very reasonable.

Even on a regular-temperature day or indoors, there is a good bit of heat coming off of this. I had to learn that it is still putting off heat when it is sleeping. So I have gotten used to shutting it down before putting it back in its little neoprene zipper sleeve.

This makes it a snap to put it on the end of a 48"" stick and I am glad I am not screwing it on and off each time because I would be afraid of fiddling with it and dropping it. I also got an orange wrist strap and have it attached to the Falcam plate. So I am glad I have the strap because again, I am afraid of dropping this expensive Snickers bar on the ground, but the wrist strap does show in the footage.<br /><br />Also, I was surprised how warm it gets when charging and recording. Even on a regular-temperature day or indoors, there is a good bit of heat coming off of this. I had to learn that it is still putting off heat when it is sleeping. So I have gotten used to shutting it down before putting it back in its little neoprene zipper sleeve. It is nothing so bad that it has stopped recording, but I wish there was a way to manage it because I am concerned about the long-term effects of heat on the electronics and the battery. I don't know that I would want to do the constant recording with overwrite mode in 6k in the summer because that would just keep adding heat in an already hot environment.<br /><br />I bought the SanDisk Extreme Pro V30 card under the advice from some forum on Reddit. It has performed very well and is not too expensive. I thought I would need a V60 or V90 card like I did in my mirrorless, but you actually can't use those.

The built-in windguard finally makes audio usable even when it's windy or the camera is moving fast with my bike<br /><br />I also really like the removable lenses, extended battery life, and improved water proofing.

I own the previous model (X4) and the X5 has really stepped it up and made a lot of improvements over the previous model. Perhaps the biggest improvements that I care about the most are the improved low light performance, the ability to replace damaged lenses yourself, rather than having to send the camera out for repair, the improved microphone/audio quality and the functionality improvements to the single lens mode. Thanks to the larger sensors the X5 is able to provide improved low light performance. It is also utilizing 3 AI chips to render the brightest image with the least amount of noise as possible.

A big issue with 360 cameras are that the lenses are very susceptible to damage and using lens guards to attempt to protect them will often severely lower the image quality. The Insta360 X5 remedies this issue by introducing replaceable lenses! Previously, you had to send in your camera to have damaged lenses repaired which would lead to weeks of down time not being able to use your camera. With the new X5 replaceable lenses, Insta360 is offering lens repair kits for $30 (each lens) that allow you to remove the damaged lens and replace it with a new lens. You can do this in the comfort of your own home or on location. No need to send your camera out for repair! From my understanding it is very simple and it only take about 30-45 mins.

1,1 - US,1,421,gl_camera,B0F5QKYDH7,B0DZCBYCNY,76110643881,Well made..but,"This is really amazingly big.  I haven't shot too much video with it because it is quite prominent putting it on a stick.  My plan was NOT to use it as an action camera but more for b-roll production.  I am going to keep it for that.<br />However, upon researching, I found that this is not an 8k camera sinc e the individual sensors are 4k.  The problem is tht you don't use the whole sensor.  The design dictates a circle inscribed on a 4k sensor.  So you're loosing 20% or more of the light sensitive area.  So you're really down to about 2.7k.

The only 360 camera I had was the 2017 Samsung gear 360 and this camera is a million times better.  I have each of the dji osmo pockets and have been using those for several years, the gear 360 technology wasn't where it needed to be at that time so I just gave up on it and stuck to gopros and then the osmo pockets. The problem I have is all the years of footage I have, I'm rarely in the video. So I really wanted to try a newer version of the 360 cameras and this one is in my opinion perfect. This technology has come a long way. Stitching the videos together at lightning speeds is insane. The video quality is insane. The battery life is great.  Being able to use the app and basically be the cameraman and go through and pan and zoom and get the shots you want is absolutely amazing. There's no way I have learned everything this camera is capable of yet, but so far is has blown me away. I took it to the lake today and it fit in my front pocket easily, so I like the size even though its a little bigger and heavier than my osmo pockets. I love how it captures absolutely everything, no worrying about missing shots, for the technology, robust construction, being waterproof and video/image quality, this camera is well worth the price. The dome lens covers and battery are replaceable, I really like that. I plan on taking this up mountains and who knows where else, and knowing that the critical parts are replaceable gives me peace of mind. Plus I can keep a spare battery on deck if I run out of juice.  Oh! And the camera is very simple to use, I didn't read up on anything, just powered it on and was able to go through all of the settings with ease. I also was able to download the app and use it on a s25 ultra with no problems. Has a stable wifi connection as well. I am amazed by this camera each time I use it.

The only 360 camera I had was the 2017 Samsung gear 360 and this camera is a million times better.  I have each of the dji osmo pockets and have been using those for several years, the gear 360 technology wasn't where it needed to be at that time so I just gave up on it and stuck to gopros and then the osmo pockets. The problem I have is all the years of footage I have, I'm rarely in the video. So I really wanted to try a newer version of the 360 cameras and this one is in my opinion perfect. This technology has come a long way. Stitching the videos together at lightning speeds is insane. The video quality is insane. The battery life is great.  Being able to use the app and basically be the cameraman and go through and pan and zoom and get the shots you want is absolutely amazing. There's no way I have learned everything this camera is capable of yet, but so far is has blown me away. I took it to the lake today and it fit in my front pocket easily, so I like the size even though its a little bigger and heavier than my osmo pockets. I love how it captures absolutely everything, no worrying about missing shots, for the technology, robust construction, being waterproof and video/image quality, this camera is well worth the price. The dome lens covers and battery are replaceable, I really like that. I plan on taking this up mountains and who knows where else, and knowing that the critical parts are replaceable gives me peace of mind. Plus I can keep a spare battery on deck if I run out of juice.  Oh! And the camera is very simple to use, I didn't read up on anything, just powered it on and was able to go through all of the settings with ease. I also was able to download the app and use it on a s25 ultra with no problems. Has a stable wifi connection as well. I am amazed by this camera each time I use it.

I suggest the first thing you do is insert a Micro-SD card, hit record, and hold the X5 up in the air for a minute, maybe if you can, just walk around somewhere with it.<br /><br />When you play the video back, just slide your finder on the screen up, down, left, or right, and it will pan on the screen as if you were literally pointing a camera in that direction. You'll never have to worry about where to point the camera ever again.<br /><br />Editing in Insta360 Studio is a breeze; you open your recorded videos, and then click an icon to add what's called a ""key frame"" to the timeline. A keyframe is just a dot placed on the timeline which tells Insta360 Studio to change something on the video at the selected point in time on the timeline; it is not required to use them for the record.<br /><br />Examples of things you might change are changing the direction the camera is virtually pointed, changing picture settings like color intensity, brightness, or adding special affects, it's very simple.  Once you're done adding key frames to your video, you can export the video which will contain all of the changes, if",5,,"Records everything around you, all 360 degrees, you'll never miss a shot again",0.75,84f2e72b-2133-428b-a38f-77dfa0a1d85a,product component related specs or functionalities,camera related,recording feature,recording feature - generic,positive,2025-06-08T04:47:09.000Z,2025-08-16T17:54:19.000Z,2025/6/7 00:00

Not sure what kind of magic they're putting inside these cameras, but they continue to impress. the new Pure Video feature works great in the dark as long as you're not moving too fast or waving the camera around.

That's the biggest thing ever. i replaced one set after the camera fell off my car off roading.",5,,the new Pure Video feature works great in the dark as long as you're not moving too fast or waving the camera around,0.69,9ec5ecfe-217a-4d23-852d-ec4a7bd08532,product component related specs or functionalities,video resolution clarity,video quality,good pure video feature,positive,2025-07-29T14:49:40.000Z,2025-08-24T19:40:38.000Z,2025/7/26 00:00
