Good low-light performance too, since the lens & sensor are so good: low-light image doesn’t get all grainy, and the camera automatically increases or decreases the exposure level to adapt.

It folds up when not being used, so the lens is basically closed, and it has a green light around the base when active.

1,1 - US,1,147,gl_pc,B0BCF8QYH4,B0B826KS4B,76793792671,It doesn't work with Apple's FaceTime software,"The product description says this webcam is compatible with Mac OS.  It also says that the webcam is ""Fully compatible with Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and more.""  Since all Macs are pre-loaded with FaceTime webchat software, you might assume from InstaLink's ads that, since the product is compatible with Mac OS, the camera just HAS TO be compatible with FaceTime.  (Remember the ""and more"" part of "". . . Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and more""?)  But if you assume this, you will be wrong.  I do note that the webcam works flawlessly on the Zoom platform.  But it is NOT compatible with FaceTime.  While the image your FaceTime chat buddy will get of you will be a nice one (but I did notice occasional image freezes during a typical chat session), the audio quality will not be acceptable.  The voice you transmit will be full of echo and other artifacts.  When the person you are calling tries to reply to you, he will hear his own voice in a slight delay.  Adjusting your audio output will not solve the problem.  According to InstaLink's technical support, ""Our team has confirmed that the Link 2 and Link 2C do not have built-in echo cancellation algorithms. Instead, they rely on the echo cancellation capabilities of the software being used, such as FaceTime.""  What this means is that unless you wear headphones while you chat, do not use FaceTime with this product.  Use Zoom.",3,,2025-06-18T21:31:15.000Z,2025-08-24T16:51:04.000Z,2025/6/14 00:00

However, it's not overtly huge.<br /><br />The tracking feature is nice with three (3) levels of speed. However, most will remain seated in one position; but it will compensate for slight movements.  Auto focus is great to keep you looking pristine.<br /><br />4K video can introduce a bit of video noise for objects in the background. It can be lessened by reducing the frames per second down from 30fps to 25fps or 24fps. 1080p video is the sweet spot.<br /><br />Upon starting your computer, it will go through a calibration sequence of about 5 seconds with no video. A privacy lens is not needed when the camera is not in use as it returns to a downward facing position. Background choices are nice when your room is a bit unsightly; or you’d rather not have your audience know you’re in the bedroom or another area you’d rather not reveal.<br /><br />FYI, on my Mac Mini M4 I had to go into settings and activate “camera extensions” to use backgrounds as they are unavailable upon Initial install of the software. 24/7 tech support guided me through the activation process which I contacted at 1AM CST.

I've used Streamer.bot and Move Value Plugin in OBS to allow my Twitch chat to move the camera with their channel points. They can always check in on the cats whenever they want now. Connectivity is instant and the software is really decent. I finally used the DeskView function to stream fixing my GPU. It worked great. I would highly recommend this camera and am hopeful they hear our pleas to update the software so we can use multiple cameras with it. It's a niche thing that few people are going to want but those of us that do REALLY want that ability. Oh lastly it's SUPER durable. I have it mounted to a suction cup quarter inch mount on a window and the cats have knocked it off of there serval times already dropping it about 5 feet each time. It's held up like a champ. I looked at a ton of reviews between this and the Obsbot Tiny 2 and this just wins overall. Sure Obsbot has more filters but honestly they kind of suck. Just use 3rd party stuff for filters.

If I ever get it back, I'll update its ability to function.<br />UPDATE: Despite noting on the service ticket that they had replaced the motherboard, I'm happy to report that they sent me an entirely new working webcam.

After some research, the Link2 seemed like the best choice. But in practice, it falls short. For starters, I can’t use Microsoft Teams and the Link Controller app at the same time. This means I have no way to control the camera once I’m in a Teams call — a huge limitation.<br /><br />When I do have the Controller app open, I try to focus the camera on me, maybe even “train” the AI to recognize my face. But after about a minute, the AI gets distracted and starts tracking my wall clock instead. I've contacted support and hope they can help, but so far, the tracking has been unreliable at best. If this isn’t resolved, I’ll have to turn tracking off entirely and position the camera manually — which defeats the purpose of buying this model.<br /><br />The hand gesture controls are a neat idea, but they rarely work. I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled the software, updated everything (software and firmware), and still no luck.<br /><br />Occasionally, when I plug in the camera, the image appears flipped upside down. The only fix is manually toggling the Horizontal Correction tab.<br /><br />Bottom line: the Insta360 Link2 feels more like a beta release than a finished product.

Algo que aclarar es que no esperen la calidad de video de una cámara profesional, tiene una buena calidad, pero al final es una webcam. Si quieren grabar videos o hacer stream y verse como los grandes, lo mejor es adquirir una cámara profesional, pero para iniciar y para crear contenido está cámara es la ideal.",5,,2025-08-20T15:49:04.000Z,2025-08-22T09:14:50.000Z,2025/8/16 00:00

1,1 - US,1,421,gl_camera,B0DY1PP7XG,B0DNK381B3,77581457271,Don't expect iPhone image quality.,"While this camera seems to be ok so far and is FAR superior to the HyperX Vision S, the image quality is middling.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*The autofocus speed is decent. It will take longer than you expect to focus on another object.<br /><br />*USB C connectivity is there and you're not limited to a permanent cord.<br /><br />*There is a shutter cover.<br /><br />*No issues with Teams or WebEx (though you are limited to 1080p).<br /><br />Cons:<br />It heats up quickly. Heat kills. In a small package without vents or heatsinks, it will degrade the components in short order. I'd recommend an extended warranty.<br /><br />The magnetic connection to its mount is not useful to me, as I use it connected to a tripod or solid mount and the possibility of it detaching and falling to the floor is high.<br /><br />The microphone sound quality is poor, but I use an external microphone for most things.<br /><br />My use case is 50% meetings and 50% recording a monitor / display that I am working on. The image quality when it's pointed at a screen is poor, no matter how far away or how well lit the area.<br /><br />If you just need a new webcam, it seems ok for $100. Above that, I'd consider other, newer options, as image quality might have improved.",3,,2025-07-25T19:24:49.000Z,2025-08-24T08:29:31.000Z,2025/7/19 00:00
