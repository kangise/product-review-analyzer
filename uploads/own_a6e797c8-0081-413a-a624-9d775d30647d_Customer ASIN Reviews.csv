1,1 - US,1,147,gl_pc,B0DHQHZ1BS,B0DDTH3HX8,76229365891,Insta360 Link 2: The Ultimate Web Cam,"The Insta360 Link 2 is an incredible device. I bought this even though my Apple Studio Display has a built-in Web Cam; however the video quality is subpar.  Another reason is that I use a BenQ Halo monitor lamp that covers the camera.<br /><br />FYI, I had to purchase the device in the link to mount it on the BenQ Halo. However, it’s not needed if you don’t use a monitor lamp. BenQ’s proprietary Webcam mount is out of stock with no date of re-stock.<br /><br /> https://www.amazon.com/JCWINY-Accessory-ScreenBar-Adjustable-Computer/dp/B0CQFSVW7N<br /><br />Back to the Insta360 Link 2. Setup is easy and straight forward. Great functionality. The size is appropriate for a Web Cam of this type with powered mechanisms inside. However, it's not overtly huge.<br /><br />The tracking feature is nice with three (3) levels of speed. However, most will remain seated in one position; but it will compensate for slight movements.  Auto focus is great to keep you looking pristine.<br /><br />4K video can introduce a bit of video noise for objects in the background. It can be lessened by reducing the frames per second down from 30fps to 25fps or 24fps. 1080p video is the sweet spot.<br /><br />Upon starting your computer, it will go through a calibration sequence of about 5 seconds with no video. A privacy lens is not needed when the camera is not in use as it returns to a downward facing position. Background choices are nice when your room is a bit unsightly; or you’d rather not have your audience know you’re in the bedroom or another area you’d rather not reveal.<br /><br />FYI, on my Mac Mini M4 I had to go into settings and activate “camera extensions” to use backgrounds as they are unavailable upon Initial install of the software. 24/7 tech support guided me through the activation process which I contacted at 1AM CST.  Another great reason to purchase the Insta360 Link 2.<br /><br />The Insta360 Link 2 is sightly expensive at $199_USD.

I've used Streamer.bot and Move Value Plugin in OBS to allow my Twitch chat to move the camera with their channel points. They can always check in on the cats whenever they want now. Connectivity is instant and the software is really decent. I finally used the DeskView function to stream fixing my GPU. It worked great. I would highly recommend this camera and am hopeful they hear our pleas to update the software so we can use multiple cameras with it. It's a niche thing that few people are going to want but those of us that do REALLY want that ability. Oh lastly it's SUPER durable. I have it mounted to a suction cup quarter inch mount on a window and the cats have knocked it off of there serval times already dropping it about 5 feet each time. It's held up like a champ. I looked at a ton of reviews between this and the Obsbot Tiny 2 and this just wins overall. Sure Obsbot has more filters but honestly they kind of suck. Just use 3rd party stuff for filters. I've had this thing since November 2024 and it's been awesome. I'd genuinely love to buy more of them and just get rid of my crappy Logitech cams altogether but much like Logitech there's still no support for multiples of the same model in the software. Would love to save some money and buy more if this camera but so far it's looking like I might have to step up to a big boy POE PTZ setup for multiple PTZ cameras. Still don't regret buying this thing. It's the perfect middle ground between webcam & actual surveillance PTZ cams.",5,,It's Great Camera,0.98,3a04e280-e0d2-4c7f-814a-e79b94db281c,product component related specs or functionalities,quality,camera quality,camera quality - generic,positive,2025-06-01T22:35:35.000Z,2025-08-22T16:24:41.000Z,2025/5/31 00:00
