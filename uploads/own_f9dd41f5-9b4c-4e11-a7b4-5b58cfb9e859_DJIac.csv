I can film in high resolution for extended periods without a single issue—it's incredibly stable and reliable (no overheating or random lockups).<br /><br />The image quality is truly fantastic, but the standout feature for me is the HDR video. The way it handles scenes with bright skies and deep shadows is magnificent, makes our videos really look great for YouTube.<br /><br />Pairing it directly with the DJI Mic 2 is another game-changer, providing crystal-clear audio that syncs perfectly without a fuss.

1,1 - US,1,421,gl_camera,B0DTLNMT2T,B0DBQTC2P7,77401138131,Frustrating at first but great now.,"Updated review: it imports nicely into Apple photos, FCPX, and some other apps but doesn’t produce a desktop drive icon. This I think is a Apple software mod that does not show this product as a disk mounted on Desktop. I am now impressed with the great software tools and Quik app so I’m updating to 4 stars.<br /><br />First review: I’m a retired pro photorapher, used to own 5 studios and did a lot of database coding in the process. I’m running an M1 Macbook Pro , Sonoma 15.5.  This GoPro 13 couldn’t connect to my wifi after many trys, and all of a sudden, after waiting a day, it decided to connect.  I had made no alterations to my wifi.  Then after doing some shots, and connecting the usb c cable to the camera to offload images, it would not show up on the desktop.  I never have this problem with any other items. I learned that this a common issue.  So, next I decided to manually pull out the SD Card. I -refuse- to go through this gyration every time I want to offload images to my Macbook.  The placement of the SD Card slot is worse than on my old GoPro 3+. Very difficult to get to and difficult to extract the card. I run Canon R5 II, Sony A9II, Sony A6700 and many other cameras that this one ain’t worth the effort.  Will probably return it.  On the plus side, there are many useful features on this product.

If you are inside of some place like your office, bedroom, the camera will capture your voice perfectly. But if you are outside and you need more attention to your voice I recommend to get the microphone DJI mic 2 because the comes with the receiver inside already, and for sure the receiver connection is way better than a Bluetooth connection.<br />With the receiver connection you can be in a such huge distance and the microphone will still capture your voice. Totally different of a Bluetooth connection it gets maximum 10m if you don’t have any interference.<br />So what I can say go pro is nothing close of DJI 5 pro you can you as a personal camera for a blog, webcam, Studio camera and of course a amazing action camera, without worrying about over hea",5,DJI,you wont be able to record in total high quality anyway,0.74,2d912863-5178-46af-8c67-3175912faa7c,product component related specs or functionalities,camera related,recording feature,recording feature - generic,negative,2025-06-15T13:59:18.000Z,2025-08-23T15:06:46.000Z,2025/6/14 00:00

Right off the bat, the new 1/1.3"" sensor delivers incredible low-light performance. I took it biking at dusk through some wooded trails, and the clarity and detail were far beyond what I expected. I was able to portray different light settings.<br />The enhanced subject tracking is great aspect! Thanks to its powerful 4nm chip, the framing adjusts quickly, even when I'm moving fast or switching angles. Whether I’m filming in landscape or portrait (16:9 or 9:16), it keeps me or my subject perfectly centered with little effort on my part.<br />Activating the camera via the DJI Mimo app was pretty straightforward -although it’s worth noting that the app isn’t on Google Play anymore. I just scanned the QR code right on the camera screen and downloaded it that way—quick fix, but good to know ahead of time.<br />One of the most practical upgrades is the battery life. I’ve easily pushed close to 4 hours of use on a single charge. This is great for when you out for extended periods of time.<br />The dual OLED touchscreens are another favorite feature—bright, colorful, and super responsive. I can easily frame shots, review footage, and adjust settings without second-guessing what I’m seeing, even in full sunlight.<br />Of course, stability matters most with action cams, and the 360° HorizonSteady tech does not disappoint. Whether I’m riding, hiking, or just filming handheld, the footage stays incredibly smooth. It’s almost surreal how steady it looks.<br />Lastly, the audio quality is surprisingly crisp.

This ting is tiny but packs a punch! And the battery is great so far because when you film, there’s also a display saving mode where the screen goes dim and only shows you the duration of capture so far. I do want to record long road trips down the line, so I may pick up some spare batteries eventually. The build quality is nice, sturdy, and waterproof, which is also something I want to take on my adventures when we travel abroad.

I’ve done my research and the Insta360 Ace Pro 2 has a shield for the audio to reduce noise which is a great perk.
