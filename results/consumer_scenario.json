        "This camera is great! I use it almost daily and has great quality. I love the face tracking and that I can configure it to my stream deck.",
        "I work remotely and find that high quality conferencing equipment is worth it, but I've been putting off getting a better webcam since big review sites claim that there's not basically no difference between high-end equipment and the standard Logitech C922. Well, they're wrong and this is drastically better.",
        "I have already recommended this product to all my colleagues. The quality is amazing and I get asked about it all the time. I work for a software company and spend all day in zoom calls so this was a must.",
        "Works beautifully during conference (eg, Zoom) calls. My criticism is that I see the camera on and recording me even when I have not started a webcam meeting or recording.",
        "This camera is incredibly fussy about whether it will connect audio and video for Teams and Zoom calls. In may instances it will be working and then turn itself off the minute I make a Teams call."

        "I've been using this webcam for streaming and will soon be using it for zoom, and the ai tracking features are so helpful for keeping me in frame. It is 4k quality as advertised, and all you have to do to connect is plug and play.",
        "Love the qaulity. The AI Tracking is very good! Perfect for Live streaming for games!",
        "I bought this webcam to use in making videos for YouTube. The camera is well designed and well made. It has been flawless in setting up and in using. It takes video to a whole new level over a MacBook Pro webcam.",
        "Getting it set up with the controller was so complex and then I didn't have a way to set it up with streaming on twitch or anything. Also when using the controller to record and take pics I can't find where that stuff went.",
        "I really wanted to love this. The picture quality is excellent. HOWEVER, the dongle to adjust the angle will freak out occasionally panning all the way up or down when you are just trying to adjust slightly. This is not only embarrassing but also DANGEROUS if you are live streaming."

        "My daughter purchased this for me, as I am a volunteer tutor who aids adults to pass their GED on line via my computer. Even though it stopped working, their tech representatives made it ease to send back at no charge and no quibble repairs made. It's a great camera that you can also use a whiteboard for presentations to students.",
        "This thing has been a gamechanger for me at work. So much so that one of our C-level execs saw it in action and ordered them for his whole staff. If you have a lot of Teams/Zoom calls where you're working with diagrams, being able to just walk to your physical whiteboard without any fiddling or setup is GREAT.",
        "Awesome. Heads up it does not do white board mode when pointing down at your desk.",
        "I finally used the DeskView function to stream fixing my GPU. It worked great.",
        "Its so convenient to just hit one button for the desk view and grab a pen/paper on a Teams/Zoom call."

        "This is a great little camera. I was stunned at its performance. Tested using Ubuntu Linux, macOS and Windows. For Linux users, there is no \"official\" app, but you can control it from OBS or using a free app called \"WebCamControl\" and available as a FlatPak.",
        "I tested five other cameras on top of this one, and NONE of them could even come close. The picture quality is outstanding and jam-packed with features that I'll never even use.",
        "For the price, you just can't beat it. I've only had it for one day, but I've put it through the paces and it's a tiny little beast. Picture quality is really great, even at 1080p60fps. It's damn near it's 2160p30fps quality. Almost can't tell the difference.",
        "simply LOVE this little guy. keep thinking its a little robot but its not. im a fan of gadgets so as soon as i saw this thing online it intrigued me. it does the trick as a webcam for sure. great quality but i dont think i have a powerful enough machine to get all of the full experience out of it because it can do A LOT."

        "The product description says this webcam is compatible with Mac OS. It also says that the webcam is \"Fully compatible with Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and more.\" Since all Macs are pre-loaded with FaceTime webchat software, you might assume from InstaLink's ads that, since the product is compatible with Mac OS, the camera just HAS TO be compatible with FaceTime."
