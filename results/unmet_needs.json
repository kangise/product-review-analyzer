        "Stopped working in less than a week. Customer service website it barely useable. The process to send it back for repair is slow",

        "It doesn't work with Apple's FaceTime software. The voice you transmit will be full of echo and other artifacts",
        "Too many issues with Teams and USB Hub usage. It doesn't have proper driver support to work well through USB",
